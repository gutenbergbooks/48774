<p>One glance at a map of the Western
Hemisphere is all that is needed to show
the splendid situation of Eastern Quebec
and the Maritime Provinces of Canada
as the natural summer recreation centres
for the people of a continent.</p>
<p>Communicating with the world&rsquo;s
greatest system of inland waterways;
washed by the salt spray of the rolling
Atlantic; blessed with innumerable lakes,
majestic rivers, dashing waterfalls and sparkling brooks; clothed
with noble forests; featured by towering mountain chains, and swept
by cool health-bringing breezes&mdash;these delightful domains are surely
the summer provinces of all America.</p>
<p>Who has not read with fascination and delight the thrilling
pages of Canada&rsquo;s romantic history; or has not been stirred with
deep emotion over the adventures of that trio of great explorers:
Cabot, Cartier and Champlain!</p>
<p>The desperate struggles of the early colonists with the savage
Iroquois Indians; the long and fluctuating conflict for supremacy
between France and Great Britain; the incursions of the New England
Colonists; the mixed settlement of Colonial Loyalists, French,
English, Scotch and Irish; the Acadian Expulsion&mdash;all have combined
to make Quebec and the Maritime Provinces a field that is rich in
interest and quite unlike any other part of the
continent.</p>
<p>Here buried treasures of legend and story
are on every hand, promising rich reward to the
happy discoverers.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_4">
<img src="images/p0011c.jpg" alt="" width="484" height="636" />
</div>
<p>There is a fascination in seeing places
where the people of long ago have lived, and
where epoch-making events have occurred; for
there we may learn at first hand and from personal
observation many things that cannot be
read in the printed page.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>

</div>
<p>How delightful to stand where Jacques Cartier
planted his symbolic cross with its emblazoned shield
bearing the royal lilies of France, and to remember
that here his banners were first unfurled to the
breezes of this western land. And while the loyal
sons of St. Denis saluted the fluttering flags as the
guns were discharged in joyful salvo to mark the
birth of an empire beyond the seas did the wondering Indians
understand the full meaning of the ceremony, or realize that this
handful of men was but the advance guard of a mighty host propelled
by a still mightier force&mdash;the power of civilization&mdash;that
would compel the poor &ldquo;sons of the forest&rdquo; to give way before the
irresistible onrush?</p>
<p>This sixteenth century invasion of Canada seems very remote
to us; but long before Columbus, Cabot or Cartier set foot on the
Western Continent, other Europeans had visited it.</p>
<p>From the first contact of the white man with his red brother,
the Aboriginal tribes living along the North Atlantic coast had well
defined and century-old traditions of a wonderful ship that had
been cast ashore manned by strange white men who were all drowned.
In Norse history, also, there is the Saga of Eric the Red relating to
the discovery of the east coast of North America, before the Christian
Era was a thousand years old. Whittier refers to this in his legendary
verses, &ldquo;The Norsemen&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;What sea-worn barks are those which throw</p>
<p class="t0">The light spray from each rushing prow?</p>
<p class="t0">Have they not in the North Sea&rsquo;s blast</p>
<p class="t0">Bowed to the waves the straining mast?</p>

<p class="t0">Onward they glide,&mdash;and now I view</p>
<p class="t0">Their iron-armed and stalwart crew,</p>
<p class="t0">Joy glistens in each wild blue eye,</p>
<p class="t0">Turned to green earth and summer sky;</p>
<p class="t0">Each broad, seamed breast has cast aside</p>
<p class="t0">Its cumbering vest of shaggy hide;</p>
<p class="t0">Bared to the sun and soft warm air,</p>
<p class="t0">Streams back the Norseman&rsquo;s yellow hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Vikings are believed to have had a fishing station at
Gasp&eacute; in the tenth century, and it is almost certain that in the few
following centuries Norman and Basque fishermen sailed up and
down the waters of the St. Lawrence.</p>
<p>But early history, although interesting to those who would
know something of the land in which they sojourn, is only a background
for the natural beauty and other material features of the
provinces. Beginning, therefore, with Quebec,&mdash;which although
ocean-swept and geographically maritime, is not one of the Maritime
Provinces,&mdash;and proceeding east, a brief survey is now made of New
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia inclusive of
Cape Breton.</p>

<p>The Province of Quebec is highly diversified
and mountainous, and full of ever-changing pictures
of great beauty. Its eastern borders are
famed for their fine highland scenery, picturesque
lakes and romantic glens. In many
parts the scenery is majestic, with everything
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
on a grand scale; and the mountains, woods, lakes, rivers,
precipices and waterfalls all combine to make the country one of the
grandest in the world. Canada&rsquo;s beautiful Mediterranean, the
noble St. Lawrence, traverses the province from south-west to
north-east, and receives as tributaries the great rivers Ottawa,
Richelieu, St. Maurice and the Saguenay, as well as a multitude
of other rivers of considerable size.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What river is this?&rdquo;.....asked Cartier of his Indian pilot,
when first he sailed over the broad expanse of the St. Lawrence.
With impressive dignity came the reply, &ldquo;A river that has no end.&rdquo;
How apt this conception was is apparent when we remember that
in its widest sense&mdash;for the great lakes are but river beds of the Ice
Age&mdash;the St. Lawrence system is over 2200 miles long.</p>
<p>It is interesting to remember that all the early navigators
sailed up the St. Lawrence with the hope of thus reaching China
and the Indies. It was this quest for a direct western seaway to
the Orient that led to the discovery of the North American continent.
Indeed, in Roman times and many centuries before the
Norse discovery of a thousand years ago, Iberian shipping, bound
west, is believed to have reached the St. Lawrence as far as
Tadousac and the Saguenay River. All of these daring navigators
believed that the Western shores reached by them were the
bold headlands of the Asiatic continent.</p>
<p>The value of Cabot&rsquo;s discovery of the Western continent in
early days&mdash;or the niggardly character of the &lsquo;royal&rsquo; Henry&mdash;may
be inferred from the following entry in the expenditure account,
for the year 1497, still to be seen in the British Museum: &ldquo;August
10th........To hyme that founde the new Isle........&pound;10.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great Champlain, in his search for a western waterway
to China, penetrated as far as the lake in the State of
New York that now bears his name.</p>

<p>There is such a wealth of scenic beauty in the Province
of Quebec, and such a delightful, old-time life is found in
its many quaint villages, that a tour in any part of the
province is full of very pleasant
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
surprises. Without much imagination you may believe
you are in a province of Old France. Thoreau, the naturalist,
thought it appeared as old as Normandy itself, enabling him to
realize much that he had heard of Europe and the Middle Ages.
When you leave the United States you travel in company with the
saints, for the names of villages such as St. Fereol, Ste. Anne, The
Guardian Angel, and of mountains such as Belange and St. Hyacinthe
are all along your route. The names &ldquo;reel with the intoxication of
poetry&rdquo;&mdash;Chambly, Longueuil, Pointe aux Trembles, Bartholomy,
etc. Like Thoreau you will &ldquo;dream of Provence and the Troubadours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beauties of Tadousac, and the grandeur of the &ldquo;Dread
Saguenay, where eagles soar&rdquo;&mdash;will be of deep interest to all who
reach Rivi&egrave;re du Loup on the opposite shore by Intercolonial Railway,
and who cross over on the steamships of the Trans-St. Laurent
Company.</p>
<p>There are few places in the world where such a delightful
trip of two-and-a-half hours can be taken across a great waterway.
Probably the best view of the whole north shore is that seen from
here. The blue water, the gorgeous clouds, the great mountain
ranges and the &lsquo;tang&rsquo; of the sea air will ever be remembered.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I saw the East&rsquo;s pale cheek blush rosy red</p>

<p>All along the south shore of the St. Lawrence are numerous
pleasant summer resorts; and from Rivi&egrave;re Ouelle Junction on the
Intercolonial Railway the train may be taken to the riverside wharf from
whence the steamship Champlain makes a pleasant trip to the trio of
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
splendid resorts on the north shore: Murray Bay with its sublime
Alpine scenery, rugged Cap &agrave; l&rsquo;Aigle, and charming St. Ir&eacute;n&eacute;e.</p>
<p>And then Quebec, the old-world city, the capital of the
province, the historic centre of Canada and all America, the city of
Wolfe and Montcalm! Surely the thought of her glories brings a
flush of pride to the faces of French and British alike. No city in
all America is more famous than this.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Near her grim citadel the blinding sheen</p>
<p class="t">Of her cathedral spire triumphant soars,</p>
<p class="t0">Rocked by the Angelus, whose peal serene</p>
<p class="t">Floats over Beaupr&eacute; and the L&eacute;vis shores.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Seen from the river, Quebec is noble, grand, and superb.
Its cupolas, minarets, steeples and battlements give it the appearance
of an Oriental city. Some find here a resemblance to Angoul&ecirc;me,
Innspruck and Edinburgh; and the surrounding scenery has
been likened to the unsurpassed views of the Bosphorus. The
whole prospect of mountain, river and citadel-capped city cannot
be surpassed in any part of the world.</p>
<p>The great interest excited by a near approach to the old
capital is heightened as one steps ashore, thrilled by the novelty
and beauty of all the surroundings. It is a city of striking contrasts;
and full of the quaint and curious sights that make Old World travel
so delightful.</p>
<p>The environs, too, and the whole surrounding country are
rich with historic, romantic and picturesque interest.</p>
<p>It is related that a touring party in an automobile arrived
recently at Quebec at 8.30 in the morning. They had breakfast,
&lsquo;did&rsquo; the city and surrounding country, had luncheon and were off
for other parts by 1.30. This is surely a &lsquo;record&rsquo;; but...... poor
Quebec! or rather, poor travellers! ........ for pity should be theirs.</p>
<p>A stay of a month will bring daily joys to the one that loves
legend and romance, and all that is quaint and beautiful. The
walks and drives and boating trips, the numerous pretty lakes, the
fine rivers Chaudi&egrave;re and Jacques Cartier, as well as the Ste. Anne
and smaller streams, supply constant incitement for healthful exercise;
and above all there is the story of Quebec that will call him
daily in every direction to drink at the fountain head of historic
lore.</p>

if his heart-chords are those of the poet, the scholar, the man of

<p>In such a large, well-wooded and splendidly watered province
as Quebec, the facilities for camping, boating, hunting and fishing
are some of the best the world affords; and with a river as vast as
an ocean, and widening out grandly until it meets the Atlantic,
there is an unlimited choice of bathing and summer life at almost
any reasonable temperature. The peninsula of Gasp&eacute;, too, with
its legends and tales of adventure, is one of the world&rsquo;s choicest
fishing and hunting regions; while the far northern shores of the
River and Gulf of St. Lawrence are watered by splendid rivers,
with merely a fringe of settlement, so that the untrodden interior
will give real occupation for naturalists, sportsmen and explorers
for many a year to come.</p>
<p>In the sylvan province of New Brunswick none should go
thirsty; for such a prodigality of rivers, streams, cascades, brooks,
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
rivulets and springs, all sparkling like crystal, was
never seen. In addition to its network of waterways,
the province borders on the great deep; so that from
any part of the interior it is easy to reach the St.
Lawrence, the Bay of Chaleur and the Bay of Fundy.
Nearly all of the principal rivers are intimately
connected with each other, either by communicating
streams or short portages.</p>

<p>De Monts and Champlain were the pioneer
explorers who were sent by King Henry IV. of
France at the opening of the seventeenth century to colonize
Acadia, in which old-time domain New Brunswick was included.
Stirring events have taken place, and many a clash of arms has
been heard on the St. John River. The story of the gallant Charles
La Tour and his brave wife Frances, &ldquo;the Heroine of Acadia,&rdquo; is a
thrilling one. It is an episode of which all Canada is justly proud.</p>

<p>The St. John River is the
chief member of that great system
of lakes and rivers that has won
for this province the distinction
of being &ldquo;the most finely watered
country in the world.&rdquo; It is one
of the most delightful waterways
known, and it is questionable
whether any part of America can
exhibit greater beauty than that
seen in a cruise over its entrancing
waters. Steamers may navigate a hundred miles from its mouth,
and canoes may go up another hundred miles without other obstruction
than an occasional rapid.</p>
<p>The city of St. John is full of commercial and shipping activity,
and is the natural centre of a very extensive and attractive country.
It enjoys the proud distinction of having the great reversing fall, the
only one in the world.</p>
<p>The woods and rivers of New Brunswick are so famous that
they lure sportsmen and nature-lovers from all parts of the world.
Who has not heard of the Restigouche River? a truly noble and
stately stream, receiving a number of fine tributaries, and which has been
termed &ldquo;all things considered, the finest fishing-river in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the enticing Upsalquitch, the murmuring Matapedia or
&ldquo;Musical River,&rdquo; the charming Miramichi River with its hills of
verdure and valleys of green, and the wild Nepisiguit, leading to a
marvellous hunting country; these rivers, with others, are Nature&rsquo;s
highways leading to the haunts of bear, moose and caribou, and to
pellucid depths and sparkling falls where the lordly salmon struggles
so bravely against capture.</p>

<p>This province is the natural home of the canoe, and to the
native Indians we owe that bird of the wave with its birch-bark
wings. In every direction towns, villages, lakes and streams are
met that still retain their musical Indian names. Who would wish
them changed? Scattered through the forests and by the side of
many a river may be found the obliging Micmac and Maliceet
Indians, skilled in canoeing and woodcraft, and with some of whom
for guides delightful outdoor vacations may be enjoyed.</p>

<p>Prince Edward Island was first named L&rsquo;Isle St. Jean by
Champlain when he visited it in the early years of the seventeenth
century. Cabot is supposed to have called there some fifteen years
earlier, but there is no definite record of such a visit.</p>
<p>The Island is very pleasantly placed in the southern part of
the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and has deep water on every side. It was
formerly covered with dense forest growth, but this has nearly all
been cut down, and the whole island is under cultivation and is very
fertile. It presents a striking appearance on a near approach from
the sea, because of its red soil and the abundance of sandstone.
The air is delightful, and the climate somewhat milder than that of
New Brunswick.</p>
<p>Prince Edward is the Rhode Island
of Canada, for with a total population of
not one-third of that of Toronto, and
much less than a fifth of that of Boston,
the little province is self-governing, and
it has a governor, a legislature and its
own premier and cabinet, etc.</p>

<p>This pleasant and sunny little isle
is well provided with attractive names.
Because of its delightful situation, its
balmy air and prolific soil it is known far
and wide as the &ldquo;Garden of the Gulf.&rdquo;
Many of the Micmac Indians made it
their home in the early times, and from them has come the beautiful
name, musical as well as poetical, Abegweit or &ldquo;Resting on the Wave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is a pastoral simplicity and freshness about the island
that has a fascination for those who visit its shores each year in such
numbers. The early settlement by French peasantry from Bretagne,
Picardy and Normandy, the Acadian French from Nova Scotia, and
the English and Scotch settlers who followed, all give the pleasant
little towns and villages an interesting character. There are good
and safe harbors on the south side; but on the north it is difficult to
find one, unless it be where:</p>

their own; and while the land is not one of &ldquo;mountain and torrent,&rdquo;
the rippling streams, wooded banks, and smiling verdure on every
hand make walks, drives, and boating and canoeing pastimes of
happiness and delight.</p>
<p>Numerous and picturesque brooks and mill-streams are quite
noticeable features in journeying over the land; and artists, nature-lovers,
and those who admire the beautiful will surely linger in many
a tranquil and secluded spot on this happy &ldquo;isle of the summer sea&rdquo;

<p>Nova Scotia and Cape Breton
may be termed the sea-walls of the
Maritime Provinces, for they are on the
outer edge or Atlantic front where they
receive the first violent shock of the
turbulent rollers that later sweep into
the Gulf and inner waters with rapidly
lessening force, spent and defeated after
their struggle with the giant headlands
of granite.</p>
<p>As would naturally be expected, the scenery gradually changes
as Quebec and Northern New Brunswick are left behind, not in the
sense that it deteriorates, however&mdash;it simply alters its character.
There are districts, such as the Wentworth Valley, that have become
famous for their loveliness; and, as is now well known, Cape Breton
has a wild and rugged beauty&mdash;like to that of the Scottish
Highlands&mdash;that gives it a first place in the estimation of many.
Indeed, in relation to travel interest generally, it is remarkable
what great variety or diversity
of scene is found in going from
one part to the other of the Maritime
Provinces. It may truly be
said that each province has its own
distinct features of beauty, and those
who go to one district for the mountains
will have their counterpart in
others who will seek the sea and
the open shore.</p>

<p>Nova Scotia proper&mdash;for
Cape Breton, once a separate
province, is now included politically
with the Atlantic peninsula&mdash;is
almost an island, being connected
to New Brunswick by an
isthmus that is only eight miles
wide in its narrowest part. It is well watered by rivers and lakes,
and has many fine harbors. The climate is mild and delightful,
and makes it one of the most desirable places in which to spend a
summer. Although there is no lack of sunshine, the Atlantic breeze
is so refreshing, and the Arctic current that sets in against the shore
is so cooling that no one can suffer from the heat. This gives a
delightful stimulus to all outdoor recreation and sport, for, no matter
how active the employment, there is no discomfort or lassitude as a
result.</p>

<p>The climate of this province is, therefore, a glorious natural
heritage of inestimable value; and, as the years go by, the truth of
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
this statement will become more and more apparent as the country
becomes better known by summer-suffering millions to the south.</p>
<p>This is the province where fine deep-sea fishing may be had
at so many places along the coast, and where the giant leaping-tuna,
and huge, darting swordfish may be caught&mdash;royal sport, indeed!</p>
<p>De Monts and Champlain enter into the history of the province,
as do the La Tours, father and son. Annapolis Royal, the
old Port Royal of French days, has been the scene of many a conflict
in which French, English and New England Colonials took part.
The Acadian French were quite numerous here previous to the time
of their expulsion. It is a mistake, however, to presume that the
whole Acadian interest centres in one part of the Bay of Fundy side
of the province. Such is not the case; for Acadian families and
villages may be found in many parts of the Maritime Provinces.</p>
<p>The City of Halifax&mdash;the Cronstadt of America&mdash;has become
the Mecca for annual thousands of visitors from all parts of the
world. With its quaint and old-time appearance, its military and
naval interests, its magnificent situation, its World-Harbor, its
picturesque environs, lakes, forests and grand water privileges for
yachting and boating, Halifax is unique as a centre of attraction.
Moreover, it is the most convenient place from which to start for
excursions down the romantic south-shore, as well as for the Annapolis
Valley, and for all the great fishing rivers and hunting districts
that lie east between the Atlantic and the line of the Intercolonial
Railway, and extend as far as Guysboro and the Strait of Canso.</p>
<p>Nor must the beautiful country around Truro, and east and
west of it, be forgotten; nor that along the northern water front of
the province from Tidnish to Tracadie, with all the restful shore
places included in that water-bow.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia is indeed a summer country, <i>par excellence</i>. It
has splendid woodland and a fine system of rivers and lakes. Go
where you will in any part of it and you are never more than thirty
miles from the shore. Sea life is, therefore, a
prominent feature, and with all the forms of recreation
and amusement so bountifully provided,
summer days passed in the Atlantic province go all
too quickly by.</p>

<p>Cape Breton was originally called L&rsquo;Isle Royale by the
French in the time of the Grand Monarch, Louis XIV. Its history
is an eventful one.</p>
<p>At Louisbourg on the east coast, once known as the Dunkirk
of America, titanic conflicts have taken place. Its fortifications
erected there in the early part of the eighteenth century, from plans
by Vauban the celebrated military engineer, took over twenty years
in construction. Citadel, massive stone bastions, a protective moat
and huge gun batteries once existed there; and powerful fleets have
battled in front of it for New-World supremacy.</p>
<p>As in other parts of the Maritime Provinces, the New England
Colonials have left their impress on the history of Cape Breton.
Here, too, are many Acadian settlements, made up of the descendants
of those who fled from the mainland while this land of refuge was
still a French possession.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to find a summer climate more agreeable
than that of Cape Breton. The days are bright and sunny, tempered
by cool and refreshing sea-breezes. There is no scorching
heat at any time, and it affords a delightful contrast with the torrid
conditions that prevail in districts a few hundred miles to the south.</p>

<p>The great salt-water lake known as the Bras d&rsquo;Or, or &lsquo;Arm
of Gold,&rsquo; runs through the whole extent of the island, with many
ramifications; and it has connection with the Atlantic by two narrow
channels. It is almost a &lsquo;tideless ocean,&rsquo; for before the water can
lower itself to any appreciable extent, the Atlantic low tide has
turned and is becoming high again. It is therefore an ideal place for
yachting and motor boating; while in the pretty rivers and lagoons
are found choice waters for boating and canoeing.</p>
<p>Fine mountain ranges and magnificent scenery make Cape
Breton a delightful country for summer pleasures. A drive along
the &lsquo;Arm of Gold,&rsquo; and in almost any part of the island, is a delightful
experience. Baddeck, Whycocomagh, Arichat, Louisbourg, the
Sydneys, Ingonish and Mabou, as well as the Margaree and Middle
Rivers, are all places of delight for vacationists. Fine forests of
oak, birch, maple and ash, with plenty of the woods more commonly
seen, are here in great profusion.</p>
<p>A climb up the great height of Old Smoky, the <i>Cap Enfum&eacute;</i>
of the French, lands one almost in the clouds; and on a clear starlit
night when the moon is in the heavens, a view is spread out below
that can never be forgotten. The walks and drives in the lovely
valleys, with towering mountains ever visible&mdash;the white gypsum
at their base&mdash;a shimmery halo above; they, too,
take a deep and fond hold on the memory.</p>

<p>The Intercolonial Railway forms the
greater part of the system known as the Canadian
Government Railways. With the road known
as the Prince Edward Island Railway, together
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
with other shorter branch lines gradually coming under Government
control, to their betterment, the whole system gives ready access to
all of Central and Eastern Quebec and the Maritime Provinces.</p>
<p>This system may truly be called the fairy godmother of the
Maritime Provinces, for with outstretched arm it has placed the
five extended fingers of a fostering hand over the important commercial
centres of Montreal, Quebec, St. John, Halifax and Sydney,
causing them to pulsate with life, and bringing them into intimate
relation with the great centres of the sister provinces from Atlantic
to Pacific.</p>
<p>Merely to sit in one of the numerous comfortable trains, and
observantly tour the main line, is a novel experience, a revelation
of beauty and an education in itself; but if to that is added a sojourn
in one or more of the localities best suited for the individual preference
of the traveller, the result will be satisfactory and exhilarating.</p>
<p>While it is true, in a measure, that almost any part of the
Intercolonial summer country will amply satisfy all general requirements
for vacation pleasures, it should be remembered that an
intelligent choice should be made of a district that is rich in those
things essential for the enjoyment of those who intend going there.</p>
<p>To this end the present book has been written. It will be
found accurate and reliable; and a careful perusal of its contents
will give full information on all points of interest. Through its
pages are distributed Indian legends, Acadian tales, and stories of
hunting, fishing, boating, canoeing, and camp, tent and bungalow
life, etc., embodied in the description of the districts to which such
incidents properly belong. The natural history, or nature-interest,
in animal, bird, fish and wild-flower life is a feature of the book that
must give pleasure to those who go to a country like that described
to enjoy life in the open.</p>
<p>A comprehensive index is also provided of events, subjects,
districts, places, persons and things. When the reader has completed
the first reading of the book, this index will afford ready
means for turning to those subjects that linger in the memory, that
enlighten travel and that enhance the pleasure of it; while as a
practical and every-day guide for things it is necessary to know, the
same index is sure to be helpful in looking up all necessary information
from time to time.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly best to approach
Quebec by way of the south shore;
the city, as is generally known, being
on the north side of the St. Lawrence.
Whether coming from Montreal and
the south-west, or St. John, Halifax
and the east, the Intercolonial Railway
brings the traveller to the most
convenient point, L&eacute;vis, immediately
opposite Quebec.</p>
<p>Here, taking one of the ferries, and with a seat under the
awning of the upper deck, a splendid view is had of the further
shore as the steamer makes its way across the river. No need to
ask, &ldquo;What place is this?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Is this Quebec?&rdquo; Such a question
would be absurd, for here in all its grandeur is the great St. Lawrence
River, there clusters Quebec around the grim old rock, and
yonder, high up, where proudly floats the flag of empire in the active
breeze, is the King&rsquo;s Bastion, with the old citadel, the Ch&acirc;teau
Frontenac and all the spires, peaks and towers that make this place
like an ancient picture from the Old World.</p>
<p>What a delightful experience it is to look upon sights and
scenes that are novel and beautiful, full of charming local color,
and permeated with that atmosphere of grandeur and power that
quickens the pulse and causes the thrill of emotion to telegraph its
way through the nerve centres. As soon as Quebec is approached
it becomes immediately apparent that it is rich in all those things
that excite human interest; and if the opinion of others is needed,
the testimony of that galaxy of the great, famous in geography,
literature, science and art&mdash;that long procession of renowned men
and women that has taken its way hither in unbroken pilgrimage
through the past centuries&mdash;is all based on the one majestic keynote
of wonder, admiration, reverence and love for all that Quebec typifies
for the people of two hemispheres.</p>
<p>How pleasant to sit and view the magnificent prospect up
and down the noble river, and see the great mountains that tower
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
and then disappear in the distant blue haze. What
glorious clouds; and what beautiful effects of light
and shade the bright sun paints on the broad outspread
canvas of nature that surrounds us! It
needs but the sight of Quebec in its grand setting of
striking beauty and the simple melodies of the people
heard from violins and harp amidships, to transport
the mind in a delightful reverie of the past.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_31">
<img src="images/p0035.jpg" alt="" width="331" height="487" />
</div>
<p>In fancy we see the Henrys, the Edwards, Good &lsquo;Queen
Bess,&rsquo; James, poor Charles, the sturdy Lord Protector, Cromwell,
and all the long line of crowned heads whose history is woven in
with that of Eastern Canada. And then the French King Francis,
the two <i>Henri</i>, and the four <i>Louis</i>, with Champlain, Jacques
Cartier and Frontenac; the noble missionaries who came here to
teach the savage Indians&mdash;murdered, or burnt at the stake for
their devotion; the great captains, including England&rsquo;s Nelson, the
brave soldiers down to Wolfe and Montcalm, and since; the Norman
and Basque peasant settlers, the <i>coureurs du bois</i>, the buccaneers,
privateers and adventurers; all these have figured in Quebec&rsquo;s
remarkable history.</p>
<p>A bump at the landing dock recalls us to the present, and
as we step ashore it is with reverence akin to that which we feel
when standing under the towering Norman greatness of Durham
Cathedral, or when in the sacred precincts of Westminster Abbey
where lie buried the genius and achievement of centuries.</p>
<p>And now Quebec is reached, and some of the things that
will ever be in mind after this memorable visit are now before us;
and weeks of happy experiences are about to unfold their treasure
to our admiring gaze.</p>
<p>There is no better way of understanding and appreciating
what the old city holds in store than that of first rambling about in
every direction on foot. With occasional car trips and with a drive
now and again in a <i>caleche</i>, the plan of the city and its environs
becomes gradually clear. The sight of the quaint streets and of
the many old features that are so novel on the new continent will
be enjoyed because seen without guide or premeditation. The
process known to our English cousins as &lsquo;knocking about,&rsquo; which is
to saunter where you will, on foot and without haste, is the best
way in Old Quebec. It is on foot that terrestrial things are seen
intimately, and when we have made a dozen &lsquo;rounds&rsquo; of the lower
town, walked along the ramparts again and again, rambled in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
citadel, promenaded on Dufferin Terrace,
quenched our thirst at the Frontenac,
climbed the glacis, walked the
parapets, viewed the majestic scene
from the King&rsquo;s Bastion, sauntered
over the Plains of Abraham, and circled
the city until every spot is known;
then, and not until then, shall we drink
in enough of the atmosphere, and be in a condition to take an intelligent
view of all that surrounds us, awaiting the keen examination
that cannot be made in a hasty or superficial manner.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_32">
<img src="images/p0036.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="382" />
</div>
<p>Of the general appearance of Quebec it will be enough to
quote from the words of three of its famous visitors. Thoreau wrote:
&ldquo;I rubbed my eyes to be sure I was in the nineteenth century.&rdquo;
Dickens recorded: &ldquo;The impression made upon the visitor by this
Gibraltar of America, its giddy heights, its citadel suspended, as it
were, in the air; its picturesque, steep streets and frowning gateways;
and the splendid views which burst upon the eye at every
turn, is at once unique and lasting;&rdquo; while Henry Ward Beecher
set down these as his impressions: &ldquo;Curious, old Quebec!......
of all the cities on the continent of America, the quaintest......
We rode about as if we were in a picture book, turning over a new
leaf at each street!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A brief survey of the history of New France, or Eastern
Canada, is a necessary preliminary for the full enjoyment of all
those things for which Quebec is famed.</p>
<p>Commissioned by Henry VII. of England, Cabot sailed west
in search of a route to China and India, and discovered America.
This new land he set down as the coast of China. The discovery
was not immediately followed up by further exploration or settlement,
and not until the year 1534 did Jacques Cartier, the St. Malo navigator,
make a voyage of discovery for the French sovereign Francis
I. The intrepid sailor succeeded in reaching the western continent,
or New France, and landed at Gasp&eacute;, where he erected a cross with
an inscription on it claiming the country for the King of France.</p>
<p>Winter approaching, he made his way home again. Before
leaving he had entrapped two natives, and these he took with him
as evidence of his success.</p>
<p>In the year 1535 Cartier made a second western voyage, and
this time he sailed up the great river which he named the St. Lawrence.
At that time the fish were so plentiful that the progress of
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
the little flotilla of three tiny ships was often
greatly impeded. Bears, also, were very numerous,
and quite expert in catching the fish for their food.
It was a common sight to see Bruin plunge into
the water, fasten his claws in a great fish and drag
it ashore.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_33">
<img src="images/p0037.jpg" alt="" width="408" height="552" />
</div>
<p>The native Indians were also seen, in
canoes, hunting seals and catching white whales.
Alarmed by the approach of the strange men in
their marvellous vessels, the savages paddled off with haste; but on
being addressed in their own tongue by the two returned captives
on Cartier&rsquo;s vessel, they abandoned their flight and returned to
gaze with astonishment and child-like wonder at all they saw.</p>
<p>Cartier was informed of the existence of an Indian village
of considerable size at Stadacona, quite near to Quebeio or Quelibec,
and there he met the great chief Donnacona, the &lsquo;Lord of Canada.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is no complete agreement on the origin and meaning
of the name &lsquo;Quebec.&rsquo; Some have traced its derivation from the
word &lsquo;Kepek,&rsquo; the aboriginal equivalent for &lsquo;come ashore,&rsquo; supposed
to have been addressed to Jacques Cartier when he hove-to
near Stadacona. Others have surmised that it sprang from the
exclamation of a Norman sailor on first seeing the great cape&mdash;&ldquo;Quelbec!&rdquo;
(&ldquo;What a cape!&rdquo;) Again, the Abenaquis word &lsquo;Quelibec,&rsquo;
meaning &lsquo;narrowing&rsquo; or &lsquo;closed,&rsquo; is supposed to be the real derivation;
while a very strong claimant for recognition is the Indian word
&lsquo;Kebeque,&rsquo; which means &lsquo;a narrowing of the waters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Learning of another large native village on the St. Lawrence,
a considerable distance above Stadacona, Jacques Cartier determined
to proceed there with one of his vessels.
The chief Donnacona, a shrewd old savage, did
not favor further penetration of his domains,
and calling to his aid some of his tribe dressed as
&lsquo;devils,&rsquo; he hoped to frighten the bold navigator
with the frightful whoopings and noisy invocation
to the demons who were supposed to inhabit the
forests.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_34">
<img src="images/p0037a.jpg" alt="" width="439" height="734" />
</div>
<p>Cartier pushed on, however, and leaving
his vessel near the place now known as St.
Maurice, and proceeding in the ship&rsquo;s boats,
reached Hochelaga, the site of the present
Montreal. The village was circular in form, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
a strong palisade surrounding it. The one entrance was well guarded
by removable barriers, and platforms were erected inside from which
stones could be showered on possible assailants. The square or
assembly-ground was in the centre, having grouped around it the
birch-bark wigwams or houses. Their weapons and implements
were of rock, and their simple life was communal.</p>
<p>The impression made by the advent of the white-faced men
from another land had a pathetic side; for the diseased and blind
were carried out from their rude shelters in order that the great
White Chief should cure their infirmities by the &lsquo;laying on of hands.&rsquo;
But alas! the white man was not divine&mdash;and the poor Indians were
consoled by presents of hatchets, knives and beads, etc., followed
by the thrilling sound of a &lsquo;flourish of trumpets.&rsquo;</p>
<p>During Cartier&rsquo;s absence a fort and winter camp had been
constructed at Stadacona by his men, the site of which may be seen
on the River St. Charles. Cartier gave the name of Mount Royal
to the mountain overlooking Hochelaga village, and this name has
survived in the Montreal of Canada&rsquo;s commercial capital.</p>
<p>Early next Spring Cartier, and all the remnant of his band
that survived after a severe attack of scurvy, sailed for France.
A serious blemish in Cartier&rsquo;s character is shown by the record of
his having carried off by force&mdash;torn from their homes and country&mdash;poor
old Donnacona, &lsquo;Lord of Canada,&rsquo; and other chiefs. They
died in captivity, far from their kin, and with the sad memory of their
great river and noble forests ever with them to the end.</p>
<p>Cartier returned to New France a third time after some five
years; but the seed of distrust was sown in the minds of the natives
by the absence of their stolen chiefs, and it was not long before the
fruit of hatred and strife developed and gradually grew until it
steeped the country in continual war and bloodshed. Cartier again
set out to proceed up the river to Hochelaga, but finding the natives
had been warned and were becoming hostile he turned back to
Stadacona. He eventually returned with Roberval to France, and
died in his native St. Malo about the middle of the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>It is interesting to learn that Roberval&rsquo;s titles were Viceroy
and Lieutenant-General of Canada, Hochelaga, Saguenay, Newfoundland,
Belleisle, Labrador and Baccalaos.</p>
<p>France was now seeing stormy times in her home affairs,
and no well-directed effort was made to follow up Cartier&rsquo;s work&mdash;although
other explorers and fur-traders crossed the stormy seas in
their endeavor to make a settlement in the New World.</p>

</div>
<p>At last the brave and capable Champlain
sailed from Harfleur in 1608, and reached
Stadacona or Kebec in safety. Here at the
foot of the rock where the quaint street Sous
le Fort has since been made, a settlement was
laid out which Champlain called &lsquo;l&rsquo;Abitation
de K&eacute;bec,&rsquo; and which consisted of three
lodgings and a store-house, all fenced in and
surrounded by a ditch.</p>
<p>Champlain made several trips to
France, each time bringing back missionary-priests and settlers. He
built, a fort on the height above his &lsquo;Abitation,&rsquo; on the spot where
his statue has since been erected. The little colony commenced
to grow, and soon numbered some fifty people. And now began
the troubles that were to shake the infant settlement, rumblings of
more desperate encounters, for a hostile British fleet arrived, and
Quebec was compelled to capitulate. Champlain again sailed for
France, where he remained until Charles I. of England gave back
Quebec to King Louis.</p>
<p>The founder of Quebec at last, returned to the beloved home
of his adoption, where the work of building had to be done a second
time&mdash;fire having destroyed both &lsquo;Abitation&rsquo; and fort, as well as
other buildings. With energy and skill, supported in the main by
the love and esteem of his fellow colonizers, Champlain toiled on;
his noble character showing in all he did. To keep on good terms
with the neighboring Algonquins and Hurons he took part in their
struggles with the fierce Iroquois, and penetrated inland as far as
the Georgian Bay and southern shore of Lake Ontario. The greatest
vigilance was now more than ever necessary, for the savage Iroquois
crossed the great lakes in their war canoes, came down the St. Lawrence
and lurked in the woods, ever ready to cut off and scalp the
French when found in small numbers. In addition, the inexperienced
Colonists were quite unprepared for the severe winters, and
they were often on the verge of starvation.</p>
<p>Other serious troubles came. The British appeared in naval
force, and again Quebec capitulated&mdash;Champlain being taken to
England as a prisoner of war.</p>
<p>The political kaleidoscope now took another turn, and Quebec
was once more given back to France by Charles I. of England.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_37">
<img src="images/p0041.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="609" />
</div>
<p>For the last time Champlain again
returned to Quebec, this time as governor,
and his customary energy was shown in all
that related to the welfare of the colony.
In the fulness of time, rewarded by the
success of his labors and beloved by his
fellows, the great man breathed his last.
He is justly considered to have been the
ablest and best of all the early explorers
and governors.</p>
<p>The new governor Montmagny was
a worthy and capable man. He greatly
improved Quebec and commenced the stone
construction of Fort Saint-Louis. It is
interesting to note that during his incumbency the Jesuits built their
college. It was commenced in the year 1638, which makes it the
oldest institution of learning in North America, antedating Harvard
College by one year. A few years after this the Ch&acirc;teau Saint-Louis
was built within the walls of the fort.</p>
<p>Frontenac next ruled the destinies of Quebec with a firm
hand. Excepting Champlain he was perhaps the ablest governor,
although his character was marred by arrogance and sell-will. He,
perhaps better than any, understood how to hold the Indians in
check. The brave d&rsquo;Ibberville ably seconded the aggressive governor
during his second term of office&mdash;recalled to stem the victories of
the Iroquois and to repel the threatened attack on Quebec by a
British fleet. This fleet arrived and anchored off the Isle of Orleans.
To the haughty summons from Admiral Phipps, to surrender within
an hour, came the proud reply of Frontenac, &ldquo;It is
through the mouth of my guns that your general
will hear my reply.&rdquo; The attack was a failure&mdash;so
well did the guns talk. After that the able
Frontenac strengthened the defences of Fort Saint-Louis
to such an extent as to convert it into a real
citadel.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_38">
<img src="images/p0041a.jpg" alt="" width="342" height="826" />
</div>
<p>Towards the close of the seventeenth century
Frontenac passed away. The troubles of Quebec were
not by any means ended. A great army and fleet
under the British Admiral Walker was sent out to
reduce and occupy Quebec. In going up the St.
Lawrence River during a dense log, a number of the
transports were wrecked on Egg Island. More than a thousand
men were drowned. This calamity saved the threatened city, for
the officers of the expedition became disheartened and abandoned
the project.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>As a sequel to that terrible loss of life in the great outer waters
of the St. Lawrence there has survived one of those traditions of
which the story of &lsquo;The Flying Dutchman&rsquo; is the prototype. In
the words of Moore:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;There lieth a wreck on the dismal shore</p>
<p class="t0">Of cold and pitiless Labrador</p>
<p class="t0">Where, under the moon upon mounts of frost,</p>
<p class="t0">Full many a mariner&rsquo;s bones are tossed.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Yon shadowy bark hath been to that wreck</p>
<p class="t0">And the dim blue fire that lights her deck</p>
<p class="t0">Doth play on as pale and livid a crew</p>
<p class="t0">As ever yet drank the churchyard dew.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">To Deadman&rsquo;s Isle in the eye of the blast,</p>
<p class="t0">To Deadman&rsquo;s Isle she speeds her fast;</p>
<p class="t0">By skeleton shapes her sails are furl&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">And the hand that steers is not of this world!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The Treaty of Utrecht brought peace to France and Great
Britain in a division of the land for which they had contended. It
was agreed that Canada, Isle Royal (Cape Breton) and l&rsquo;Isle St.
Jean (Prince Edward Island) should belong to France; while Great
Britain received Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and the Hudson Bay
Territory.</p>
<p>In the succeeding years the two countries again drifted into
war, and by the year 1759 it was apparent that Quebec was once
more to be attacked. Before the year was half over,
a British fleet bearing 18,000 men dropped anchor
near the eastern end of the Isle of Orleans. Troops
were landed to the east of Montmorency River, and
batteries were erected there and at Point L&eacute;vis opposite
Quebec. A bombardment lasting two months soon
followed. The ensuing land struggle, known as the
battle of Montmorency, brought face to face the two
great leaders, Montcalm and Wolfe, upon whom France
and Britain respectively depended in the contest for
supremacy on the North American continent.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_40">
<img src="images/p0043.jpg" alt="" width="309" height="680" />

<div class="img" id="pic_41">
<img src="images/p0044.jpg" alt="" width="426" height="572" />
</div>
<p>Wolfe was studying his plan of attack, and
making feints in several directions to confuse the
enemy. Finally on the last day of July the British
troops forded the Montmorency River, and with
the guns of the fleet shelling the enemy&rsquo;s trenches
the attacking force made a concentrated rush on
the western bank to carry the position by assault.</p>
<p>The French were well placed, and the
plan of defense was excellent. The lines had
previously been strengthened at every favorable
attacking point by the able general Montcalm, and he had a
picked reserve at hand ready to hurl it in whatever direction it
should be most needed.</p>
<p>The British lost heavily, and Wolfe abandoned the attack
in that direction and recalled his troops across the river.</p>
<p>This trial of strength was the prelude to more serious work.
Wolfe, weakened by illness&mdash;and against the counsels of his officers
who were almost unanimous that the siege should be abandoned&mdash;persisted
in his determination to reduce Quebec. More than a
month passed by before new plans were perfected, but at last
towards the middle of September a new assault was commenced.</p>
<p>Soon after midnight the boats of the British stole quietly
along the Sillery shore under cover of the darkness. In the foremost
boat was a Highland officer who spoke the French language.
&ldquo;Qui Vive!&rdquo; rang out the challenge, as a sentry detected the shadowy
boat making inshore. Fortune surely favored the British, for the
Scotchman had no difficulty in passing himself off as a French officer
in charge of a detachment bringing expected supplies for Quebec.
Some of the boats had drifted further east beyond the inlet now
known as Wolfe&rsquo;s Cove. Here what had always been regarded as
an impossible ascent was found practicable by the sturdy mountain-climbing
Highlanders. Swarming up the unprotected height they
immediately overmastered the scattered sentries, captured in his
tent the sleeping officer in charge, and sent back word to General
Wolfe that the ground was clear. The troops were disembarked at
once, and the dawn of day revealed the British lines on the Plains of
Abraham, their right wing extending to the heights and their left on
the St. Foye Road.</p>
<p>Montcalm was not aware of the momentous occurrence until
the heights had been occupied in force. His troops were at Beauport,
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
some miles away, and before they could be
brought up to resist the advance of the invading
force the morning was well in progress. As soon
as it was known that the British were making
entrenchments, the French general decided upon
an immediate attack to prevent them from
strengthening their position.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_42">
<img src="images/p0045.jpg" alt="" width="436" height="567" />
</div>
<p>Soon after ten o&rsquo;clock on the bright
September morning, Montcalm advanced impetuously
to the charge. Down the ravine the
French rushed, the formation of the ground causing some confusion.
They stopped to re-form within a few hundred yards of the advancing
British, but ere they could climb the hill a frightful volley,
hitherto held in reserve, now wrapped the advancing host in a death-flame
that caused terrible havoc. Montcalm was in the forefront,
heroically urging forward his wavering troops; while Wolfe on the
right of the British advance was in the thick of the deadly fray.</p>
<p>A bullet struck the British general on the wrist. It was
hastily bound with a handkerchief. At the head of the Louisbourg
grenadiers he pressed eagerly forward, when he was struck a second
time and dangerously wounded. His bright uniform made him a
mark for every sharpshooter. And now a bullet entered his breast.
He staggered. Alas! the wound was mortal. &ldquo;Support me,&rdquo; he
hastily cried, &ldquo;my brave men must not see me fall.&rdquo; He was carried
to one side and laid on the grass. &ldquo;A surgeon!&rdquo; cried a grenadier
officer. &ldquo;It is useless,&rdquo; faintly uttered the gallant Wolfe, &ldquo;I am
done for.&rdquo; He was gradually lapsing into unconsciousness.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_43">
<img src="images/p0045a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="668" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;They fly,&rdquo; came eager comments
from the sad group surrounding
the dying general. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
quickly uttered Wolfe, arousing himself
by one last, painful effort.
&ldquo;The enemy!&rdquo; came the glad reply,
&ldquo;they are yielding in every direction.&rdquo;
Wolfe immediately gave the
important order to speed to the St.
Charles River, capture the bridge
and thus cut off the enemy&rsquo;s retreat.
He turned on his side, and, as he
murmured, &ldquo;the Lord be praised, I
die in peace!&rdquo; his dauntless spirit
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
took its wing, leaving the dead hero a victor, and the founder of
an empire that great then, and greater now, is yet only in the
infancy of its splendid course.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Great Commoner&rsquo; of England, William Pitt, has well
said: &ldquo;The horror of the night, the precipice scaled by Wolfe, the
empire he with a handful of men added to England, and the glorious
catastrophe of contentedly terminating his life where his fame began
........Ancient story may be ransacked, and ostentatious philosophy
thrown into the account, before an episode can be found to
rank with Wolfe&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the French side the gallant Montcalm in vain tried to rally
his retreating forces. The path of defeat led him towards the gate
of Saint-Louis, but ere he could enter he was twice wounded. He
was assisted inside, but his injury was soon seen to be mortal. To
those around him weeping the brave Montcalm spoke: &ldquo;It is
nothing, kind friends; pray do not weep over me.&rdquo; When told by
the attending surgeon that he had only a few hours to live, he
replied, &ldquo;I am glad of it, I shall not see the surrender of Quebec.&rdquo;
Before morning his earthly struggles were over.</p>
<p>Subsequent efforts to retake Quebec from the British failed,
and ere long it was seen that the &lsquo;Battle of the Plains&rsquo; was final in
its results.</p>
<p>The monument to Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham is erected
where the great general breathed his last; while the joint memorial
to Montcalm and Wolfe, erected in the Governor&rsquo;s Garden overlooking
Dufferin Terrace, fittingly marks the great struggle that has
joined two races in one empire of happy union and effort.</p>
<p>As the coming centuries go by, this battle will not only rank
equal to that of Waterloo in importance&mdash;it will far surpass it on
account of the momentous bearing it will have on the future of the
British Empire and the progress of the world&rsquo;s true civilization.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_44">
<img src="images/p0046.jpg" alt="" width="405" height="532" />
</div>
<p>Time passed on, and in the troublous days of the American
War of Independence the much-tried city of
Quebec was destined to besiegement for the fifth
time in its history. This time the attack came
from New England; a daring one it must be admitted,
for the whole of the invader&rsquo;s forces
were brought over the Kennebec and Chaudi&egrave;re
Rivers in the face of many obstacles. Arnold and
Montgomery, after a siege of two months, planned
to capture the citadel by a bold, surprise attack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_45">
<img src="images/p0047.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="704" />
<p class="caption">Sous le Fort Street, Quebec</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>The defense, however, was an alert one, and when Montgomery
advanced with his force&mdash;as he thought, unawares&mdash;and
was almost within the walls, a frightful volley was fired in their
very faces. This discharge killed the revolutionary general and
many of his followers. The others fled. Nor was Arnold more
successful, although he escaped with his life; a life that if there
ended, like Montgomery&rsquo;s, would have terminated more gloriously
for the able but misguided American than did his after years.</p>
<p>Many prisoners were taken, the remainder escaped and
returned to New England, and the siege was raised.</p>
<p>Since then no alarm of War has been heard in Old Quebec;
and although the War of 1812 brought suffering to many parts of
Canada, none of the various struggles came nearer than Montreal.</p>
<p>The foregoing outline is intended to provide some knowledge
of historic events as an aid to the appreciation of scenes, incidents
and sketches in connection with people and places that have
been prominent in bygone years. All such details now follow in the
description of those parts of the country to which they properly
belong.</p>
<p>One of the first things to claim the visitor&rsquo;s attention will
surely be the fortifications of the city. Because these are unique
and peculiar to Quebec, not being found elsewhere on the American
continent, they command the greater interest. Leaving out of
consideration their many picturesque features, the fact that they
represent in all the glory of almost perfect preservation a system of
defense that is centuries old, and that here&mdash;one of the few such
places in the world&mdash;we may tread on the undisturbed spot and in
the very streets and houses where great, stirring events have taken
place, gives a never-failing and absorbing interest to the outer walls
and inner places of Old Quebec.</p>
<p>The advent of heavy ordnance on disappearing carriages, or
in wrought-iron turrets, the strength given to concealed batteries
through the use of smokeless gunpowder, the improvement of harbor
defense by the use of mines, torpedoes, submarine boats and electric
light, and the imminent use of aerial explosives; all these have united
to sound the knell of the old style of fortification. The day of the
hand-to-hand conflict has almost gone by, and probably we may
never again read of assault and repulse at outer walls, never hear
of the carrying of outer defenses, of the desperate struggle from one
inner defense to the other, or of the last glorious stand around the
colors on the bastion or keep. No! for man fights now more with
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
brain and eye than with hand. Science and invention
in future will destroy or annihilate the
strongest defenses, and whole armies will walk
out and surrender without a blow. This was
so at Metz.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_46">
<img src="images/p0049.jpg" alt="" width="466" height="467" />
</div>
<p>If the old days and ideas are gone, and
the picturesque defenses of moat, rampart, bastion,
keep and inner stronghold will never again
be constructed, how important it is that we should admire and
enjoy to the full their splendid survival in Quebec, before the lapse
of time and the inevitable encroachments of modern city life shall
destroy these dearly beloved monuments of the past.</p>
<p>The Citadel, Fortification Walls and Gates of Quebec now
invite examination. Starting from the convenient point where
stands Champlain&rsquo;s monument, near the Ch&acirc;teau Frontenac, do
not forget that a fort was first constructed by Champlain on the
very spot where the monument now stands; and that Montmagny
replaced the wooden walls of his predecessor with substantial stone
work. Frontenac extended the defensive lines considerably, and
added forts and bastions. Later the fortifications were again extended
and solidified under a comprehensive plan drawn up by the
great Vauban.</p>
<p>Damaged by sieges, and imperfectly repaired from time to
time, the important stronghold was often neglected; but at the
end of the eighteenth century the present works were finished by the
English. The plans were approved by the &lsquo;Iron Duke&rsquo; himself,
and the construction cost an enormous sum. The solid stone facings,
the batteries behind the glacis, the loopholed walls that seem strong
enough to defy everything but dynamite, the ditches, gateways,
underground passages, magazines, etc.; and all the accessories of a
great defensive system are present.</p>
<p>Even during their first construction by the French so much
money had been required that Louis XIV. once asked if the fortifications
of Quebec were made of gold.</p>
<p>The citadel covers about forty acres, and access to it is gained
by the solid Dalhousie Gate. There is also a great chain gate.
The soldiers&rsquo; quarters are well protected against gun-fire, and the
more important buildings are bomb-proof. The view from the
King&rsquo;s Bastion is one of the most beautiful it is possible to imagine.
The Royal Canadian Garrison Artillery have their quarters in the
barracks within the citadel. They muster a strength of from three
to four hundred men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>By means of the halyards of the flagstaff on the King&rsquo;s Bastion,
from which floats the &lsquo;Union Jack,&rsquo; two American prisoners once
escaped after they had succeeded in drugging the sentry. The
height above the river is 350 feet, and a look over the bastion at the
drop below will show the daring nature of the venture.</p>
<p>Great guns command all the landward approaches. The
waterway can also be swept by powerful cannon, while on the L&eacute;vis
side of the river are strong batteries that dominate the river and
both shores.</p>
<p>The Governor-General&rsquo;s residence is on the Citadel Square,
and not far away is the interesting Artillery Museum.</p>
<p>That portion of the defenses known as Grand Battery is at
the eastern end of Dufferin Terrace, on the edge of the cliff that
runs from the top of Mountain Hill towards Palace Gate. Here a
number of guns are disposed in crescent form. In addition to this,
and not counting those in the citadel, the following batteries may be
seen: Assembly, Half-Moon, Hope Gate, Montcalm, Nunnery
Nos. 1 and 2, Wolfe&rsquo;s Grand Battery, and, finally, two that are
smaller and unnamed.</p>
<p>The ponderous old gates that gave security to those within
the citadel walls no longer exist. In French days there were three
of these: St. Louis, St. John and Palace. The two gates added by
the British in later days have also disappeared. These were known
as Hope and Prescott Gates. What a pity that, all five were not
allowed to remain as they were! What an irreparable loss!</p>
<p>Walking around the ramparts and beginning with the picturesque
modern gateway or arch that stands where stood the former
gate whose name, St. Louis, it bears, it will be well to remember that
the old gate was venerable with age. It was built in the year 1694.
Through this outlet sorties must frequently have been made against
attacking Iroquois, and through this gate the brave and dying Montcalm
with many of his soldiers passed into the city after the defeat
on the Plains of Abraham. The handsome arch with its graceful
Norman spire, now known as the St. Louis Gate, is mainly due to
the keen interest that Lord Dufferin took in all that related to the
improvement of Quebec.</p>
<p>Proceeding north along the ramparts, Kent Gate is reached.
No gate existed here in olden days, and the cut in the fortifications
was made necessary by the desire for increased traffic facilities.
The effect of the structure is a pleasing one, and considerable interest
attaches to it because it is a memorial to Edward, Duke of Kent,
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
father of Canada&rsquo;s well beloved Queen Victoria.
Added interest will be found in the
fact that the Princess Louise participated in
the perfection of the artistic design.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_47">
<img src="images/p0051.jpg" alt="" width="476" height="669" />
</div>
<p>Just a short distance north is the site
of the old St. John Gate. There is now
neither gate nor arch here, but the portal
demolished was as old as the St. Louis Gate.
In Montcalm&rsquo;s day the old gate swung open
to allow some of his defeated troops to pass
in, and it was against this gate that part of
the American effort was directed in the futile attempt of 1775.</p>
<p>There are no remains of the old gate on the busy Palais
thoroughfare that leads from St. John Street, down towards the
River St. Charles, nor has any memorial tower been erected yet to
mark the site. The street took its name from the palace or residence
of the French intendants, and the ruins of that building may still
be seen at the foot of the hill. The old Palais Gate had many memories
attached to it, and it withstood frequent attacks from besieging
foes.</p>
<p>The comparatively modern gates of convenience, Hope and
Prescott, have both been demolished in the demand for unobstructed
streets, but it is proposed to some day mark their sites by suitable
memorials. Hope Gate was on the north side, while the Prescott
Gate commanded the steep Mountain Hill on the eastern water front.</p>
<p>Champlain&rsquo;s &lsquo;Abitation&rsquo; was near the foot of Mountain
Hill, but right out on the water. The place where he landed
in 1608, and from which the founding of Quebec dates, was about
two hundred yards to the south-west, where King&rsquo;s Wharf now
is. Champlain&rsquo;s Old Fort, stood on the very spot where now stands
the fine monument to his memory as founder of Quebec.</p>
<p>Close by, on the site now occupied by that magnificent
hostelry, the Ch&acirc;teau Frontenac, once stood the Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis,
in which Champlain, Frontenac and Carleton successively lived.
The cellar of the former building still remains under the terrace
platform. The Old Fort extended back and included what is now
known as the Place d&rsquo;Armes or Ring.</p>
<p>The old Ch&acirc;teau St. Louis was once the seat of a power that
ruled from the Mississippi River to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It
was destroyed by fire in the year 1834, and thus was lost a priceless
relic of the past.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>The unsurpassed view from Dufferin Terrace and the pretty
retreat known as the Governor&rsquo;s Garden are the magnets that compel
instant admiration from all comers. Every resident of Quebec is
justly proud of the Dufferin Promenade. It is the very heart of its
social and recreational life.</p>
<p>In a ramble, or by taking a car along the Grande All&eacute;e, the
martello towers erected about a hundred years ago may be seen,
and a little further west is the shaft erected to the memory of the
immortal Wolfe. Near these towers there were several fierce struggles
when the British advance came that way&mdash;Wolfe lying mortally
wounded only about a quarter of a mile distant.</p>
<p>The monument to Wolfe marks the spot where he died. He
received his fatal wound a few hundred feet nearer the city, but was
carried back here to breathe his last in comparative peace. His
body was interred in the family vault at Greenwich, England, a
national memorial of him was erected in Westminster Abbey, and
by special proclamation a day of thanksgiving for his great victory
was appointed throughout the British Empire.</p>
<p>It is well worth while to extend the walk west to Wolfesfield,
for on the riverside is Wolfe&rsquo;s Cove where the British landed in 1759;
and the difficulties of the steep and narrow path up the face of the
rocky height, and the midnight ascension to fame, and death, will
come vividly to mind.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Monument aux Braves&rdquo; on the Ste. Foye Road may be
reached by the St. Louis and Belvedere Roads. Here was fought
the Battle of Ste. Foye between the French and English under De
L&eacute;vis and Murray respectively. Murray was defeated. It was a
sanguinary conflict, for over four thousand brave dead are here
buried. The struggle brought no advantage to France; it was
evident by this time that the British were too firmly rooted to release
their hold.</p>
<p>A very interesting monument is that to Wolfe and Montcalm
in the Governor&rsquo;s Garden near the Ch&acirc;teau Frontenac. The English
translation of the Latin inscription is:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valor gave them a common death, history a common fame,
and posterity a common monument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This beautiful dedication is surely an evidence of that happy
union of French and British that has resulted in the enlightened
and practically independent Canada of to-day.</p>
<p>The brave Montcalm was buried in the Ursuline Convent,
and here may be seen the French and British monuments to that
gallant general.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>General Montgomery, who fell in the American attack on
Quebec, was buried in a small enclosure near the ramparts by the
St. Louis Gate. The British consenting, his remains were removed
to New York after an interval of over forty years, and were interred
in St. Paul&rsquo;s Church there. A tablet with the inscription, &lsquo;Here
Montgomery Fell, Dec. 31, 1775,&rsquo; now marks the scene of his death.
The tablet to &lsquo;Her Old and New Defenders&rsquo; who &lsquo;unitedly guarded
and saved Canada&rsquo; by defeating Arnold, should by no means be
overlooked. It is placed on the Molson&rsquo;s Bank near the Sault-au-Matelot
where the barricade then stood that was so ably defended.</p>
<p>The last of Quebec&rsquo;s great historic monuments is that to
Jacques Cartier on the way to Lake Beauport, to the left of the
Charlesbourg Road, and about a mile from the city. Here the St.
Malo navigator wintered in the year 1535-6, built his first fort, and
erected a large cross inscribed with the name of King Francis I. and
bearing the royal arms of that ruler. Here was also erected a few
years later the first Jesuit monastery of New France.</p>
<p>There yet remain to be seen four monuments of general interest.
The first, that to Queen Victoria in the Victoria Park over
the St. Charles River; the second, to Bishop de Laval near to the
Post Office; the third, on the Grande All&eacute;e, to the memory of Short
and Wallick, who lost their lives in the work of checking the great fire
of 1889; and the Soldiers&rsquo; or South African Monument, which stands
on the Esplanade, close by the St. Louis Gate.</p>
<p>This last monument was erected by the citizens of Quebec to
the young heroes who lost their lives defending the British flag in
the Boer War. On a tablet is inscribed:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Not by the power of commerce, art or pen, shall</p>
<p class="t">our great Empire stand; nor has it stood,</p>
<p class="t2">but by noble deeds of noble men&mdash;</p>
<p class="t3">heroes&rsquo; outpoured blood.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>A walk along the Grande All&eacute;e, and on St. John and St.
Valier Streets will be rich in interest. Palace Hill, too, and the
old streets of St. Paul and St. Peter are full of character; while in
the cluster of old-town streets, alleys and passageways that extend
from below the eastern ramparts to Little Champlain below Dufferin
Terrace, the visitor will find the quaintest sights the new world has
to show. Mountain Hill, Sous-le-Fort and Sous-le-Cap are streets
the like of which may be seen nowhere out of Quebec. St. Louis
Street, the Esplanade and St. Roch&rsquo;s will repay close intimacy and
examination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>

<p class="caption">Sous-le-Cap Street, Quebec</p>
</div>
<p>In a ramble that has for its object an inspection of the chief
public and historical buildings of the city, the ruins of the Intendant
Bigot&rsquo;s old palace claim attention. They are at the foot of Palace
Hill and are now used as ale and porter vaults.</p>
<p>Bigot was a high-placed scamp of the worst description.
The times in which he lived were somewhat loose, but even then he
excited much unfavorable criticism by living with a woman to whom
he was not married. One evening he got drunk, a not infrequent
event with him. Stumbling homewards he lost his way in the
woods, where he slumbered away some of his drunken stupor. Unfortunately
for her a pretty French-Algonquin maiden was passing
when he awoke. He saw and admired her, and like more than one
of the royal masters of France he built a bower for his Caroline in
the woodland depths. It is claimed she was his unwilling prisoner.
The Intendant&rsquo;s pseudo wife soon learned she had a rival hidden
away somewhere. Driven mad by jealousy she stealthily followed
the unsuspecting Bigot and found his retreat. She returned to the
city and said nothing, but soon after that a scream aroused the
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
sleeping Intendant while spending the night in his sylvan bower.
He rushed to Caroline&rsquo;s room and found her lying there, murdered,
with a knife in her heart. There are many versions of this terrible
affair, and in this connection the novel of William Kirby is well
worth reading.</p>
<p>Over the Post Office there is an effigy known as the &lsquo;Chien
d&rsquo;Or,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Golden Dog,&rsquo; which has excited much interest on account
of its enigmatical inscription, a translation of which here follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I am a dog gnawing a bone,</p>
<p class="t0">While I gnaw I take my repose.</p>
<p class="t0">The time will come, though not yet,</p>
<p class="t0">When I will bite him who now bites me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The stone tablet bearing this effigy and inscription was
originally in the walls of the old house owned by one Philibert,
which house formerly stood on the post office site. When the old
house was demolished, the tablet was saved and incorporated in the
new building. A story of murder and revenge appears to be connected
with the strange inscription, but like most of the old traditions
it is a matter of dispute. Kirby&rsquo;s &lsquo;Golden Dog&rsquo; gives one
version that makes interesting reading.</p>
<p>A beautiful maiden of Quebec was nearly the cause of closing
the naval career of the great Nelson. Had it not been for the interposition
of a true friend, the young sailor, who visited here in the
<i>Albemarle</i>, man-of-war, at the outset of his great and glorious life,
would probably have been lost to England, and Trafalgar would
have been unfought. Fortunately the insane determination of the
young sailor to stay and woo his <i>inamorata</i>, and abandon his ship
when it was ordered to India, was overruled by Davison, his true
friend. Whether persuasion or bodily force brought about the
result, after Nelson&mdash;having said &lsquo;good-bye&rsquo; to his distinguished
and lovely young sweetheart&mdash;secretly stole ashore again, is uncertain.
What is known is that he was persuaded to adhere to his duty&mdash;and
the world knows the sequel.</p>

<p>The Parliament Buildings are on the Grande
All&eacute;e, and a splendid view of the fine pile may be
had from almost any point, so well chosen is the
site. From the main tower of the building the
grand view of the superb surroundings should
be seen. The interior corridors and chambers are
very attractive, while the bronze groups and heroic
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
figures of the great in Canadian history,
by Heb&eacute;rt, in recesses along the
fa&ccedil;ade are splendid in conception and
execution. There is an excellent
library where valuable archives of
olden times are preserved. Americans
will be interested in the two
hickory trees sent from General
Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s old home in Tennessee
and which are growing on the Grande All&eacute;e to the south.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_50">

<p>Spencer Wood, with its leafy, winding roads and shady
avenues, is at the extreme western end of the city&rsquo;s suburban extension,
not far from Wolfe&rsquo;s Cove. The delightful, old roomy mansion
to be seen there was formerly used as a Governor-General&rsquo;s residence.
It is now occupied by the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province.</p>
<p>The Ch&acirc;teau Frontenac stands on a site of such prominence,
and commands such a glorious view, that few places in the world
may compare with it. The delightful architectural presentment
of all that is picturesque and graceful in old-time buildings, carries
us easily back to the fourteenth century, and even to prior times.
From its turrets, dormers, pierced towers and hundreds of windows
a prospect meets the eye that is uplifting and irresistible in its appeal
to those who love that rare combination, man&rsquo;s work at its best and
nature in her grandest mood. The panorama of the great river
carrying its proudly floating ships to and from the ocean, the L&eacute;vis
shore, the citadel, the terrace with its ever-varying throngs, the old
town away below in the giddy depths, the mountains, the distant
country dotted with its white houses, the fleecy clouds, the shimmering
haze and the far away perspective of varied beauty; all these
make a picture upon which the gaze may be intently turned, without
weariness, again and again.</p>
<p>As is befitting, the plan of the structure is irregular, and, in
the olden way, the principal entrance is through an interior court of
considerable size. The Ch&acirc;teau is built of Scottish brick and grey
stone, roofed with copper. Over the main entrance is a shield
bearing the arms of Frontenac who lived in the old Ch&acirc;teau St.
Louis&mdash;as did Champlain and others&mdash;that stood on this very site.
In plan it is more homelike and comfortable than the usual palatial
hotel, and there is an absence of the customary annoying rush,
public promenading in corridors, etc., found in the large hostelries
of the American continent. In fact the general plan is that of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
sumptuous and princely castle-mansion of olden times, sufficiently
modernized to give all necessary comforts for those who stay here.
The interior decorations, panel effects, tapestries, heraldic and
symbolic ornamentations, and the artistic furnishings will commend
themselves to all. There is so much to be seen, that all visitors to
Quebec should introduce themselves to the courteous management
and take the opportunity of making a thorough examination of the
Ch&acirc;teau interior. Do not hurry; avoid the modern detestable
rush and indigestion of sights, scenes and ideas. Make a preliminary
tour of all public places in the building, and then go through
it at leisure, making notes of all the numerous features that in themselves,
alone, are an education.</p>
<p>Laval University is famous for its treasures of art and splendid
library. It has a fine picture gallery and museums. A beautiful
and extended view of the surrounding country may be had from
the promenade on the roof of the building. In the smaller seminary
adjoining were confined the American officers who were taken
prisoners at the time of Arnold and Montgomery&rsquo;s attack on Quebec
in 1775. The buildings contain many things of interest for the
general visitor, and here a whole day may profitably be spent.</p>
<p>The Ursuline Convent, Hotel Dieu, and Cardinal&rsquo;s Palace
are also places of great interest. In the chapel of the convent the
remains of the brave Montcalm are interred. Here may be seen
the monument erected to his memory, bearing an inscription prepared
by the French Academy. A second memorial, erected by
Lord Aylmer, has an inscription of which the translation reads:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;Honor to Montcalm!
<br />Fate in depriving Him of Victory
<br />Rewarded Him by a Glorious Death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hotel Dieu, or hospital, is the oldest institution of the
kind in all America. It was founded in 1689 by the Duchess
d&rsquo;Aguillon, who was a niece of the great Cardinal Richelieu. Some
of the oldest houses in Canada originally stood in this locality. The
Hotel Dieu contains some very excellent paintings and valuable
relics of the early Jesuit missionaries who were martyred by the
Indians. While in Quebec read the story of this terrible martyrdom,
and learn what incredible suffering was endured by those brave men
who assisted in opening up the heritage we now enjoy so complacently.</p>
<p>The Cardinal&rsquo;s Palace at the crest of Mountain Hill Street
is worthy of a visit to inspect its fine apartments and reception
chamber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The English Cathedral and the Basilica are the two principal
churches of the city, although there are, of course, many other
churches well worthy of a visit. On the site where now stands the
English Cathedral formerly stood the ancient church and convent
of the Recoll&ecirc;t Fathers. The last survivor was pensioned by the
British Government. He was well known for his wit. It is recorded
that he was once asked if he knew that a priest had arrived
in town who was noted for his appreciation of the good things of the
table, but who, ever ready to be a guest, never entertained others.
The good old Father replied. &ldquo;I saw him to-day, &lsquo;going about
seeking whom he may devour.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cathedral contains splendid monuments, a fine chancel
window and a silver communion service of exquisite design and
superior workmanship. It was a present from King George III.
What is frequently seen in Europe, but rarely in America, is the
decoration of a church interior with old battle-torn regimental flags,
and here the former colors of the 69th British regiment are draped
over the chancel. In the Cathedral enclosures once stood a precious
elm under which Jacques Cartier is believed to have assembled his
followers on their first arrival in this part of Canada. It was blown
down over a half-century ago. The treasures contained in the
Cathedral will be appreciated by all who wish to understand Quebec
and its past.</p>
<p>The Basilica is venerable with age, dating back to the
year 1647. Two years previous to that, twelve hundred and fifty
beaver skins had been set aside to commence a fund for the
building of this Cathedral. Although it has suffered much from
fire and siege, the foundations and parts of the walls are those of
two-and-a-half centuries ago. Champlain&rsquo;s &lsquo;Chapelle de la Recouvrance&rsquo;
was in the rear of the Basilica, and traces of its walls are
still visible. The edifice contains many
beautiful paintings and it is also rich in
memorials of great historic value. In fact
many of the works of art seen here are almost
priceless. Rare gifts from the &lsquo;Grand Monarch,&rsquo;
Louis XIV. may here be seen; and the
building contains enough of interest to occupy
a good portion of a rainy day.</p>

<p>Many pleasant spots are in the immediate
neighborhood of Quebec, and some
that are also intimately connected with events
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
of the past. A drive through the pretty village of Charlesbourg and
beyond, and some four miles east, may terminate at the ruins of the
Ch&acirc;teau Bigot, known as Beaumanoir, and also called the &lsquo;Hermitage.&rsquo;
It was here the tragedy in connection with the beautiful
maiden of French and Algonquin extraction took place; for it will
be remembered that this was the woodland bower or country house
of the infamous Intendant Bigot whose city residence was the palace
at the foot of Palais Hill. The building was originally a very extensive
one, with many secret passages. Until within recent years the
burial place of poor Caroline was marked with a flat stone that had
the letter &lsquo;C&rsquo; chiselled on it.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_52">
<img src="images/p0059.jpg" alt="" width="677" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Indian Lorette may be reached by carriage, or by a short run
on the Quebec and Lake St. John Railway. The country through
Charlesbourg is very pretty, mountainous and splendidly wooded.
There is a grand fall of water at the Indian village where the
Lorette courses along a romantic bed and dashes madly through
wild and rocky gorges. Huge masses of stone have fallen from the
cliffs, and in places small trees have gained a foothold on the
apparently bare tops of these rocks. They often assume odd
forms, and particularly so when they grow sidewise from the perpendicular
clefts in the face of the rocky banks. The bottom of
the gorge is rugged and striking. Huge table rocks slant upwards,
and the torrents of water dashing against them rear up and pass
over or around the obstructions. The volume of water precipitated
over the fall is very great, and the whole scene as the eye follows the
river bed is most striking. It is a novel experience to stand or sit
on a ledge fronted by a huge boulder in the middle of the narrow
channel or gorge. The Lorette gaining here in depth rushes down
with great force, and as the river is deflected it rises up a seething
pillar of water, so that, at only arm&rsquo;s-length the curious sight may be
viewed. Nearly everyone feels the fascination of a waterfall like
this, with its ever-changing form
and merry, boisterous song. The
romantic descent into the ravine
is something to be remembered&mdash;nothing
could be wilder or so
touched with Nature&rsquo;s art. Just
above the village is the Ch&acirc;teau
d&rsquo;Eau, from in front of which the
water is conveyed by conduits
to Quebec. The scenery on
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
the river above the Ch&acirc;teau is charming,
and a boat or canoe trip may be
taken to Lake St. Charles through a
most delightful sylvan country.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_53">
<img src="images/p0060.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="416" />
</div>
<p>The Hurons live in the Indian
village. They are industrious and
peaceable, carrying on the manufacture
of snowshoes, moccasins, and basket
work, etc. In the height of the summer
a good number migrate to the populous
resorts of Murray Bay and the Lower St. Lawrence.</p>
<p>There is a fine view to be obtained by going up the eminence
on which stands the attractive French village of Lorette.</p>
<p>Lakes St. Charles and Beauport, the Jacques Cartier River,
Lake St. Joseph, and the river Ste. Anne are all delightful objectives,
and they are within convenient reach of the city.</p>
<p>Quebec is fortunate in the possession of beautiful environs,
and at Montmorency Falls there is a spectacle of grandeur that in
itself is worthy of a pilgrimage of hundreds of miles to behold.
Montmorency is about eight miles from the city, and it may be reached
by carriage over the St. Charles River and by way of Beauport,
or by the electric railway. The cataract has a fall of over 250 feet.
The roar of the waters, the fascination of the billowy masses of white
foam, and the rainbow-like play of colors in the dashing spray
all hold the spectator spellbound. A fine general view is obtained
from the station of the electric railway; but no adequate conception
of the real grandeur of the sight may be formed until
the view is taken from the observation platforms. A full descent
should be made to the bottom of the steps that have been provided,
and the view should be seen from the upper platforms or terraces
as well.</p>
<p>The piers of the old suspension bridge are still standing near
the brink of the falls. The bridge gave way and swept to destruction
a farmer and his family who were driving across at the time.</p>
<p>Another good view of the falls may be obtained by crossing
the Montmorency Bridge to the park on the eastern side of the river.</p>
<p>The natural steps in the solid rock of the river bed, about a
mile above the falls, are no longer visible since the height of the river
at that point has been much increased by the dam below. They
were hewn out by the action of the rushing water of past centuries.
While they were visible thousands of people were attracted there to
wonder over the strange sight. The Fairy
River nearby should also be seen, and a walk
through the fields to the power-house will
bring a reward in the grand view of towering
rocky banks and the bridal-veil of water that
falls over the height.</p>

<p>Near where Montmorency village
stands was fought the first battle between
Montcalm and Wolfe, this engagement being
the prelude to the great attack on Quebec
that resulted in the death of both illustrious generals and the permanent
addition of Canada to the British Empire.</p>
<p>Governor Haldimand&rsquo;s fine old mansion, the Kent House,
where the Duke of Kent once lived, is now a delightful hostelry of that
ideal kind where a semblance of home life may be enjoyed amidst
restful and picturesque surroundings. There is a glorious view in
every direction from the breezy highlands, and no one should miss the
picture of Quebec seen from this vantage ground.</p>
<p>The Falls of Montmorency have not the breadth or extent of
the celebrated Falls of Niagara. Their height, however, is much
greater; and the rural and picturesque environment, as well as the
graceful and lofty character of the waterfall, combine in a splendid
prospect that has no equal anywhere.</p>
<p>Of the pleasant recreations in and about Montmorency, the
Zoological Gardens maintained by Holt, Renfrew &amp; Co., of Quebec,
afford never-ending occupation for young and old alike. The numerous
animals, etc., are well arranged for purposes of observation, and the
interesting collection shows animal life in a way that is sure to bring
many hours of enjoyment to those who ramble along the pleasant
paths that have been laid out in various directions.</p>
<p>Everyone has heard of Ste. Anne de Beaupr&eacute;, the quaint and
medieval village, some twenty miles from Quebec, where the celebrated
Church of La Bonne Ste. Anne is situated to which pilgrimages are ever
being made by the faithful, and which is so full of interest and local
color for those who merely go there to enjoy a pleasant excursion.</p>
<p>If an early riser, it is a good plan to take the electric limited
train, known as the &ldquo;Fast Pilgrimage,&rdquo; at 6 a.m. This train stops
first at the Church of La Bonne Ste. Anne and discharges nearly
everyone of its passengers at the pretty little park-station in front of
the church. The train then runs on a few hundred yards to the village
of Ste. Anne de Beaupr&eacute;, where that particular run terminates. Those
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
who go to worship will, of course, pass into the church at once in time
for the early mass. As they do so they will not fail to notice that
nearly every passenger goes direct to the church. One or two sightseers&mdash;for
the hour is early&mdash;will saunter about and enjoy the delightful
air and very foreign surroundings to pass away the time before
having a country breakfast at one of the numerous hostelries with
which the neighborhood is provided.</p>
<p>The Church of Ste. Anne presents a fine appearance, both
within and without. The style of architecture is very pleasing, and
the church stands in the midst of beautiful and well-kept surroundings.
The interior, with many quaint decorations and numerous little
chapels, is especially interesting, while a never-failing attraction for
all is the huge pile of crutches and other appurtenances of bodily
suffering or infirmity that have been thrown away by their happy
owners who, it is stated, were miraculously cured here after making
their devotions at the shrine of the celebrated Ste. Anne.</p>
<p>There is so much that is novel to be seen here&mdash;indeed it is the
only place of the kind in the whole continent&mdash;so much beauty in the
surroundings, and so much of the grandeur of nature everywhere,
that he whose heart is not actively stirred must be too dead and inert
for the wonderful appeal to move him.</p>
<p>With no stretch of the imagination the district may be called
American Alpine, and almost equal to the Swiss Alps in real interest.
In fact this is an older civilization, and all the accessories of race,
customs and manners, and country lend themselves naturally to the
production of the strangest effects. What quaint narrow streets are
here; and see the overhanging balconies at almost every story of the
foreign-looking houses that are placed at the foot of the steep hills,
nestling close to them.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_56">
<img src="images/p0063.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="500" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Almost every building in the village is a hotel, restaurant, or
store for the sale of relics, curios, novelties and souvenirs. Everything
contributes to the general <i>fete</i> or holiday-like appearance of the place.</p>
<p>In addition to the constant stream of visitors coming from
Quebec, etc., by electric trains, special trains arrive at L&eacute;vis and
Quebec that come from all parts of the provinces, quite frequently.
Sometimes as many as four and five trainloads will be here in one
day&mdash;all brought out to the church by the comfortable electric cars.</p>
<p>There is no better way of seeing the beautiful valley of Beaupr&eacute;
than by walking from the Church of Ste. Anne to the village of St.
Joachim, a distance of something less than five miles. The high
mountain-sides are liberally wooded with noble trees to near the
roadway, where banks that are clear of wood slope more gradually,
and not too steep to climb with a little effort. The daisies are so
profuse in many places that the effect is nearly like that of a snowstorm.
Particularly so where the young orchard is springing up, the
spaces between the rows of trees being quite white.</p>
<p>No country could be richer in waterfalls of all sizes, from the
precipitous and mighty fall of Montmorency down to the dashing
cascade that starts out from the mountain side. In some places they
may be heard but not seen, until in looking beyond the road a tiny
stream is seen to be making riverwards, and further examination
reveals a charming fall in some leafy copse on the other side of the
road. The tones of these waterfalls, cascades, rivulets and springs
are musical, grateful and soothing to ear and spirit beyond the power
of words to describe; while the water, sparkling and clear, is pure and
refreshing to the thirsty wayfarer.</p>
<p>Wildflowers are very prolific, sweet-scented and a constant
joy to the eye.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_57">

<p class="t0">In the forest&rsquo;s green retreat,</p>
<p class="t">With the branches overhead&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>will be found the iris, violet, trillium,
water lily, and, at times, delicately colored
orchids; while crowning the neat white
fence of many a humble cottage festoons
of trailing roses gladden the way.</p>
<p>There is a pleasant walk at Ch&acirc;teau
Richer, up to the mill by the bend of the rippling
Rivi&egrave;re &agrave; la Puce. The still water above, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
dark shade and the peaceful calm, all
repay the little <i>detour</i> necessary to visit
this charming spot. This is surely the
land of the waterfall, for the falls of
St. Fereol, Ste. Anne, Seven Falls and
the fall of La Puce are all romantic
and wonderfully picturesque. Though
difficult of access, they are like hidden
jewels&mdash;well worth the effort necessary
to reach them.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_58">
<img src="images/p0065.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="500" />
</div>
<p>So precipitous are the mountain heights hereabouts, and so
well wooded, that although there are houses on the very brinks above
the roadways, nothing can be seen of many of them from below save
chimney tops and curling wreaths of smoke. A near view of the chimneys
shows them to be of generous size, and in appearance like the
old-fashioned stoves or ranges with the lids off&mdash;the orifices, however,
being oblong, and not round.</p>
<p>Bake-ovens of huge proportions are often found in the gardens,
under the protection of a few boards to give shelter to the cook from
rain and sunshine. Owing to frequent subdivisions of the farms, as
sons grew up and had a strip allotted to them by their fathers, some
of the fields are so narrow that there is barely room to allow a horse
and plough to turn.</p>
<p>All along the road the prevailing feature is the Alpine-like
scenery, the towering heights and the white houses nestling in the
mountain side at dizzy heights. Many houses are approached from
the road by steps and a narrow walk between two habitations. On
the next rise the same rule prevails, and so on up to the highest point.
There is seldom an attempt at a hill-side street&mdash;it would be useless,
because impossible to ascend without steps. A substitute for steps,
however, is sometimes found in a sloping pathway that passes obliquely
from the front of one house to the rear of the next, and so on until
it reaches the top.</p>
<p>The old manner of laying out or planning a house still prevails.
The kitchen generally runs the whole length and breadth of the house&mdash;often
a kind of half-basement effect is seen, open in front on the road,
but closed entirely by the hill behind. Here cooking, washing, spinning,
sewing and the general household work of the industrious <i>habitants</i>
is carried on, and here is where dinner is generally served. The whole
activity of indoor life centres here; and so much was this the case in
one house that a dog and five puppies occupied the hearthstone, a
cat sat in the window nipping the green leaves of a plant, and a playful
pet lamb frisked about unrebuked while four people were in the midst
of preparations for serving the dinner. The houses are generally of
substantial construction, and capacious barns are a noticeable feature
in passing along the country side.</p>

<p>A favorite trip for those living or staying in Quebec is that on
the ferry steamers to the Isle of Orleans, originally called <i>Isle de
Bacchus</i> by Jacques Cartier on account of the rich clusters of grapes
that lined its shores when he cast anchor near. The island was
occupied by Wolfe at the time
of the fall of Quebec. There are
many summer residences here, and
it is a favorite place in summer for
many who like to enjoy the cool
river breezes.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_61">
<img src="images/p0067b.jpg" alt="" width="633" height="500" />
</div>
<p>The Falls of the Chaudi&egrave;re,
not far from the railway junction
of that name, should be seen
by everyone coming anywhere
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
near this locality. They are within easy reach of Quebec by steamboat
or railway, being only about nine miles from the city.</p>
<p>The river has a considerable width and falls gently over the
dam in a long line of silver. Passing then towards its lower channel
it falls beautifully in two, and sometimes three, cascades into the
depths below. There is a great volume of water in motion, and the
swelling sound of the roaring and foaming plunge makes pleasant
music. A climb down into the deep channel is very novel, and the
additional views thus obtained are quite striking. Here is slate
enough to supply schoolboys the world over for many a century to
come. There is a good foothold, when once in the river bed, on the
inclined and shelving stratification; and by going to the edge of the
principal fall, the war of waters against rock may be seen in all its
intensity, and, in addition, the seething depths below will cause a
shudder as the full meaning of the word Chaudi&egrave;re, &ldquo;the cauldron,&rdquo;
comes to mind.</p>
<p>The country is beautiful and well wooded. There is a charm
in the whole view when seen from the high bank from under the shade
of the noble trees: it can never be forgotten. Enough has not been
made of this district and all that it contains. It has been overlooked
in the wealth of beauty that surrounds Quebec. It is so easily reached
from either Quebec or L&eacute;vis that everyone should include the Chaudi&egrave;re
in their round of beautiful sights. Nothing could be more
enjoyable on a fine day than to take a luncheon and enjoy a picnic
in the fine woods by these famous falls.</p>
<p>It was by the valley of the Chaudi&egrave;re that Montgomery came
from New England when he made his disastrous attempt on Quebec.</p>
<p>Instead of returning to Quebec by steamer or railroad, the
electric car to St. Romuald and L&eacute;vis may be taken. The Church
of St. Romuald is one of the most important on the whole St. Lawrence
River. It has some magnificent paintings, fine altars and choice
wood carving.</p>
<p>As the car speeds along, the freshness of the verdure and the
bright gold of the buttercups will call for notice. It would be impossible
to toss a cent out of the window without causing it to lodge
in one of those gorgeous yellow cups. Nature asserts her sway
over man&rsquo;s inroads, for the railway embankments are covered with
beautiful <i>parterres</i> of purple, white, yellow, and blue blooms, with
here and there a cluster of rich, wild lupine. No more beautiful
country could be found, and the view of the great St. Lawrence, the
village-capped heights, the gentle sloping mounds nestling for protection
under the shelter of the high mountain chain, and the romantic
cuttings through the chain of hills nearby&mdash;all these make a
strong appeal to lovers of the beautiful. The little river running off
to the south-east is the Etchemin, and in it there is a pretty waterfall.</p>

<p class="caption">Scenes in the Militia Camp at L&eacute;vis</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>From the opposite shore of L&eacute;vis one of the finest views of
Quebec may be had. In fact, for miles up and down the south
shore some of the grandest standpoints for extensive views may be
found. The massive forts at L&eacute;vis, auxiliary to the fortifications
of Quebec in the general scheme of defence, are worth seeing. It
was from the L&eacute;vis heights that Wolfe&rsquo;s artillery destroyed Quebec
previous to its capture. The three solid structures that now constitute
a strong line of defence are said to be very similar to the
celebrated forts of Cherbourg. The Government Graving Dock
is well worth a visit, especially at a time when a large vessel is docked
there; for by descending the steps, walking along the bottom and
then looking up at the great mass above, some adequate idea may
be formed of the huge proportions of the modern &ldquo;leviathan of the
deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Too much cannot be said of the grandeur of scene, the beautiful
wood and dale, and the extensive panorama of country to be
viewed from the vicinity of the Engineer&rsquo;s Camp at St. Joseph de
L&eacute;vis. The characteristic and charming view of the Montmorency
Falls, with the beautiful St. Lawrence in the foreground, should be
seen by everyone.</p>
<p>A military camp for general drill and evolutions is held here
every summer, and in an amphitheatre of finely-wooded hills and
gentle slopes running down to an almost level campus or plain, the
citizen soldiers have ample room for comfortable quarters and
extensive operations.</p>
<p>On a recent occasion six regiments of militia were encamped
here, the 17th, 18th, 61st, 87th, 89th and 92nd. No better spot
for the purpose could well be imagined. The tents on the slopes,
open at the side for the air, and disclosing tastefully-grouped flags
and other interior decorations, were all well placed to take advantage
of shade and other natural advantages. In the officers&rsquo; quarters
were mess tables comfortably placed in an annex or wing. The tents
of the men gradually reaching down and on to the margin of the
plain, the groups amusing themselves, preparing for the afternoon
muster, fixing and cooking rations, etc.; and the orderlies and others
passing from group to group all made a busy picture. An impromptu
concert was in progress on a shady knoll where an artist on the accordeon
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
was sweeping the air in long curves as he sent music in every
direction. Men were playing quoits, or reading books and writing
letters under the cool shade of the maple trees. The post office at
the entrance of the encampment, the sentinel, the quarters of the
staff below, the clean hospital, and, at the foot, the view of the
broad St. Lawrence with its receding background of bold mountains,
all made the scene a stirring and well-remembered one.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_63">
<img src="images/p0071.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Group of Officers, Militia Camp, L&eacute;vis</p>
</div>
<p>The energetic Colonel-Commander and his efficient aides had
plenty of work before them in conducting the evolutions, and the
men&mdash;many of whom were doubtless in camp for the first time&mdash;did
very well indeed. And now the band formed, some regiments
closed up their ranks, formed columns and marched off up the slope
for skirmishing and outpost drill; while lower down other troops
going through manual drill sent gleams of light from their gun barrels
into the dark fir trees as the sun&rsquo;s rays were deflected with brilliant
effect. That persistent waving of flags on yonder distant knoll
has its explanation in the corresponding signals that are being transmitted
across the width of the broad amphitheatre from the edge of
a clump of maples just behind us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Colors were to be presented to one of the regiments, and a
preliminary drill was being held for that occasion on the morrow.
The ceremony, a very impressive one, takes place in the centre of a
hollow square, the troops facing in; and to the imposing and patriotic
strains of the national anthem the colors are unfurled.</p>
<p>To write that a peregrination through this whole country is
beautiful and inspiring is to feebly express the charm of it all. The
pleasure, too, of spending a day in the field with our citizen soldiery
in the midst of such magnificent and heart-stirring scenery is great;
and it brings a satisfaction and uplift to the mind that should cause
thousands to visit this neighborhood.</p>
<p>Those who sojourn in Quebec, whether for weeks or months,
will find no want of varied amusements. There are walks too
numerous to mention where wild flower, the song of the bird and the
music of the gushing rill and rocky fall enliven every step of the way.
Boating may be carried on almost everywhere, and canoes may be
placed on dozens of waters that are either quiet or rippling; according
to choice. The interior lands of this district are the very best
for hunting purposes; and many of the larger rivers are splendid
salmon waters. In all of the surrounding streams and in the pure
waters of the adjacent lakes lovers of trout fishing will find ample
occupation and unstinted reward. Motor-boating, automobiling,
golf, tennis, and all the sports of the field may be enjoyed here to their
full; while as a centre or starting place for railroad and steamboat
trips and tours in every direction Quebec assuredly takes first place.</p>

<p>From the town of St. Croix, west of Quebec,
where the river is three miles wide, to Sillery
Cove and the outlet of the Chaudi&egrave;re, the
St. Lawrence gradually narrows to a width of
less than one mile. After passing Quebec,
however, and through the double channel that
includes the Isle of Orleans, it broadens considerably,
until opposite Baie St. Paul the great
river has a width of over sixteen miles. Where
the Saguenay empties it is eighteen miles across,
at Little Metis it is over thirty-six miles, and finally to the west
of Anticosti, where it meets the waters of the Gulf, it has a breadth
of over one hundred miles.</p>
<p>The St. Lawrence carries an amount of water to the ocean
that is exceeded by no other river on the globe save the Amazon.
Its tributaries are all clear trout and salmon streams, and no water
system can compare with it for purity. It has well been said that
&ldquo;Its waters shake the earth at Niagara; and the Great Lakes are its
camping grounds, where its hosts repose under the sun and stars in
areas like that of states and kingdoms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long before it reaches the end of its course the river has
become as saline as the sea, its tide like that of the ocean, its atmosphere
about as breezy as that of the open Atlantic; and in the various
resorts that are found on both shores&mdash;but principally or altogether
on the south shore after easting from Tadousac and Les Escoumains&mdash;considerable
variety of climate will be found.</p>
<p>From Quebec to Cape Breton, and Baie des Chaleurs to Halifax
a geographical quadrangle is bounded that includes a diversity of
scene and climate, and range of temperature, that cannot be found
elsewhere; and this great variety of climatic condition enables the
Canadian Government Railways to provide on its own system congenial
places to meet requirements that are widely different in character.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>The whole area of Eastern Quebec and the Maritime Provinces
is much cooler than the New England States, and cooler also than
Ontario and the West. It will be understood that Eastern Quebec
is cooler than Western, and that a still cooler climate than that
found in Eastern Quebec is obtained by going to the Atlantic Seaboard
on the east side of Cape Breton or Nova Scotia. East and
South-East New Brunswick are cooler parts than North, and North-West
and West. Prince Edward Island occupies a middle ground in
temperature between Quebec and Cape Breton or Eastern Nova
Scotia; while in Cape Breton and Nova Scotia themselves the eastern
or Atlantic front is cooler than the western or protected side.</p>
<p>In considering summer resorts the matter of climate and
temperature is very important. What will suit one will not satisfy
another. The broad and just statement may therefore be made
that differences in temperature between various parts of the Maritime
Provinces are more equalized after sundown. At night it is cool
everywhere. Compared with the country to the south and west it
is cool in any part of the Maritime Provinces, even at high noon.
In the east the thermometer cannot rise high because of the cooling
sea breezes. The temperature in the west is therefore a few degrees
higher, and on that account the western and middle parts are often
preferred by those unaccustomed to the bracing sea air of the open
Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>The St. Lawrence in its progress oceanwards passes many a
fair island on its way. Some of the most charming views may be
obtained on and from these islands, and many of them are choice
spots for picnic and camping-out parties. The most of these
islands will be found opposite such places as Montmagny, Cap St.
Ignace, L&rsquo;Islet, Baie St. Paul, St. Alexandre de Kamouraska, Rivi&egrave;re
du Loup, Isle Verte, Trois Pistoles and Bic, etc.</p>
<div class="verse">

</div>
<p>Proceeding east over the Intercolonial Railway
along the south shore we pass in turn the prosperous
towns of Montmagny, Cap St. Ignace, L&rsquo;Islet, St.
Jean Port Joli and Ste. Anne de la Pocati&egrave;re opposite
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
Baie St. Paul and the Isle au Coudres. Montmagny is fairly near the
railway station, but the other places are on the river front and a
drive of a mile or two is necessary from each station to reach a town.</p>
<p>Baie St. Paul, on the north shore, is a place of call for the St.
Lawrence steamboats, and is within easy reach of Quebec. In a
country where the grandeur of nature is visible on every hand, it is
difficult to do justice to all the beautiful sights without seeming to
overpraise them. And yet in this romantic little resort is a wealth
of beauty that must be seen if all that is lovely in nature is not to
be slighted. It is French through and through, and therefore
delightful. Looking up the valleys of the two rivers, Gouffre and
Moulin, there is a fine view of a mountain range that fades away in
the far distance in different shades of blue. Following the rapid
course of the Gouffre there is a road from which many charming
views may be seen. The beautiful groves of trees, the bright cottages,
and the water falling over the precipice in long, silvery bands
are pleasant features of the landscape. There is a grand view from
the top of Cap au Corbeau, after the birds that make this place their
haunt have been frightened away. It was off Les Eboulements
that Jacques Cartier&rsquo;s three little vessels, the <i>Grande Hermine</i>, <i>Petite
Hermine</i> and <i>Emerillon</i>, anchored in the bay, near the end of Isle
aux Coudres, when he made his second voyage to the West.</p>
<p>Isle aux Coudres is even more French than Baie St. Paul.
Here Jacques Cartier landed on his second voyage to New France.
He gave to the island the name it has since retained, a name derived
from the numerous hazel trees he found here. It is recorded that
in 1663 a mountain was lifted by an earthquake and cast bodily
over the water on to this island. It was thus made much larger
than before. At present the inhabitants are content with their
acreage, and have no desire for further additions of this kind. A
survival of the old Norman life is here, and for this and the view of
island and mainland it is worth a visit. Small white whales are
often caught near here in great abundance.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_68">
<img src="images/p0076.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="310" />
</div>
<p>A quartette of famous north-shore
resorts is brought within pleasant
reach by the Canadian Government
Steamship <i>Champlain</i>. There is a hotel
here where people from nearby places
stay in the summer time to enjoy the
cool river air. The steamship <i>Champlain</i>
leaves the wharf twice daily for north-shore
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
resorts, making connection on its return with trains going east
and west each morning and afternoon. On Sundays the boat goes to
and returns from Pointe &agrave; Pic only, but as the other resorts are only
a few miles from that place, it is easy to reach them by carriage.
Stopping at Rivi&egrave;re Ouelle Junction, taking the train there to the
wharf and boarding the smart river steamship, an enjoyable run of
about sixteen miles brings up at St. Ir&eacute;n&eacute;e, from which place the
<i>Champlain</i> passes on eastward to Pointe &agrave; Pic and Murray Bay,
and thence to Cap &agrave; l&rsquo;Aigle. On alternate trips the order of calls is
reversed; the <i>Champlain</i> proceeding first to Cap &agrave; l&rsquo;Aigle and then
going west calls in inverse order at the other points.</p>
<p>The four resorts are entirely different in character, and to
some extent in scenery. The name Murray Bay is frequently
applied to the whole district reaching from Pointe &agrave; Pic to Murray
Bay, a distance of about three miles. This causes some confusion in
addressing and receiving letters, and it is well to remember that
the steamboat landing is at Pointe &agrave; Pic, that the Manoir Richelieu,
most of the hotels, and the heart of the resort, all within easy
driving distance of the wharf, are included in the Pointe &agrave; Pic
postal district; while the name Murray Bay properly belongs to
the postal district surrounding the old village on the Murray Bay
River some three miles distant.</p>
<p>Pointe &agrave; Pic is a beautiful summer resort much in favor
with wealthy people. It is decidedly fashionable in its general
tone, and there are many handsome residences and bungalows on
the heights and down along the cliffs and sloping fields of the Bay
shore. Carriage-driving, tennis, golf and boating are the chief
amusements. Murray Bay, by which is meant the old French
village near the river bridge, is a quaint place, less fashionable,
much more compact and town-like, and where the hotels&mdash;smaller
and not so expensive as those at Pointe &agrave; Pic&mdash;are in the midst
of the busy little main street, but within a stone&rsquo;s throw of the open
country on both sides of the river. St. Ir&eacute;n&eacute;e is smaller and
quieter than either of the foregoing places. It is about six miles
south of Pointe &agrave; Pic. Here a delightful life may be enjoyed at
a quiet family hotel right on the beach, in the midst of a charming
country side for walks and rambles. Cap &agrave; l&rsquo;Aigle is the quietest
resort of all. It is about three miles east of Murray Bay. There are
no hotels, but the roomy farm houses on the cliffs have been adapted
for the reception of visitors, and the summer life is altogether rural
and free from fashion&rsquo;s trammels.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Pointe &agrave; Pic is gay, lively and fashionable; Murray Bay,
town-like and not lonely; St. Ir&eacute;n&eacute;e, a beach resort for quiet people
who take with them their own amusements; while Cap &agrave; l&rsquo;Aigle is
suited for those who like farm and country life, with good air and
walks along the cliffs and through country fields. Pointe &agrave; Pic
and Murray Bay are nearly connected; and as St. Ir&eacute;n&eacute;e and Cap &agrave;
l&rsquo;Aigle are just a few miles south and east, there is plenty of occupation,
even for those who live in the quiet outer resorts; for the St.
Lawrence steamboats call at all the wharves, and it is easy to go
from one place to the other by steamer, as well as by carriage.
Summer costumes from nearly every part of the world make gay
the long wharf at Pointe &agrave; Pic, and with the hundreds of carriages
drawn up for the reception of visitors and guests arriving by
steamer the scene is animating, lively and full of interest.</p>
<p>The scenery of St. Ir&eacute;n&eacute;e is very fine. The shore is green
and fresh. There are no unsightly landslides, and no bare rock.
The elevation is a bold one, with high mountains behind fading into
grey and blue. The gentle-sloping shore dotted with white cottages
runs to a point at the south that is shaped like the bastion of
a fort. The shore is of rock and gravel, with sand in some places.
A stone road extends along the shore and makes a pleasant promenade.
A short distance from the wharf, north and south&mdash;in fact
directly at the wharf&mdash;is the open country where the <i>habitants</i> still
live the simple life of other days. St. Ir&eacute;n&eacute;e is essentially a summer
place&mdash;there is neither town nor village. The main road to Pointe
&agrave; Pic makes a very enjoyable course for a country ramble, as it
abounds in by-roads and quiet paths that lead through hill and dale
where may be heard the merry music of many a dashing cascade
and sprightly rill. The bungalows are all prettily placed at varying
heights&mdash;always in choice spots that command a direct view of the
water and shore. There is no obtruding village life, and no place
where &lsquo;shopping&rsquo; may be done. All the signs of life are contributed
by the summer residents. There is little or no formality. Ladies
and children lounge on the hotel piazza, saunter along the hillside
and country roads, or form sociable groups on the shore as they do
fancy-work and sewing, or write letters&mdash;the children taking their
fill of pleasure from the shore with spade and pail.</p>
<p>A few tied-up schooners float lazily at the wharf, awaiting
their next period of activity. River steamboats between Quebec,
Murray Bay and Tadousac call here, and it is also a port of call for
the Government Steamship <i>Champlain</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_70">
<img src="images/p0080.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="500" />
</div>
<p>The pleasant residences of
the Forget family are prominent
on the shelving hillside. The
balustraded promenade, high up,
with its projecting bastion or
observation terrace, its garden,
walks, seats and prettily arranged
grounds, is a delightful
point from which to enjoy a
commanding view of the shore,
the wharf and the broad vista
of waters. A short walk from each end of the main or shore promenade
brings out at little hamlets or groupings of cottages of the
native residents. They present many points of interest for visitors,
and pleasant rambles may thus be enjoyed by those who would see
how quaint a life the people of remote parts in this province still
enjoy.</p>
<p>A short distance to the north of the wharf there is a fine
stretch of clean sand, backed by rocks and turf. There are generally
low piles of newly-sawn lumber, stacked up near the wharf
end of this beach, where children may have jolly times playing
&lsquo;hide-and-seek,&rsquo; or climbing and building houses on the shore from
drift-wood, &lsquo;ends&rsquo; and cuttings. A walk of but half a mile leads to
the attractive little stream that here falls into the St. Lawrence, and
meets real waves as it plunges into its seaward goal. Across the
little stream the stray logs that have grounded, the rocks, the cottages
on the hill, the rustling trees, the soaring height of the near-hills,
the bright green of the small point, the darker green of the
great cape beyond, the dim outline of the far-away mountain range
and the broad stretch of cool waters dotted with gracefully floating
vessels; all these make ideal summer surroundings. It is a pleasant
spot. A great charm for many will be the simplicity of all, unspoiled
by crowds&mdash;fashion left out. Children may here realize all the joys
of early youth; and adults, as they rest on the beach, will live over
again the joyous days of the care-free long ago. Few who roam the
delightful strand would know it was not the seashore. It is salt
water, of course; and it may be called an inner sea without the
decided range of temperature experienced on the open Atlantic
coast.</p>
<p>Pointe &agrave; Pic (Murray Bay, South) is known the world
over for its magnificent landscapes and the rugged grandeur of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
scenery with which nature has endowed it. Precipice, gorge and
cloud-capped peaks are everywhere, and the general view, Alpine,
Scottish and wild, is superb.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_71">
<img src="images/p0081.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="408" />
<p class="caption">Cape Blanc, Murray Bay</p>
</div>
<p>Champlain called here, and it was he who named it Malbaie
on account of its rapid tide. The native French still use that name;
for the words Murray Bay are difficult to pronounce, and when
they do use this name it sounds like Mooriebay with a long &lsquo;Moore&rsquo;
and a short &lsquo;bay.&rsquo; Pointe &agrave; Pic, on the other hand, rolls off their
tongues with a delightful piquancy; no wonder they prefer to use it.</p>
<p>There is fishing, boating, sailing and bathing of a very enjoyable
kind. Aquatic life has not been developed as much as it should
have been with so many choice privileges right at hand. Carriage
driving, tennis, and, particularly, golf are supreme. Perhaps this
is not to be wondered at when the splendid and inexhaustible drives
the neighborhood affords are considered; and the golf links are so
beautiful and in such a splendid situation that the popularity of
this healthful recreation is easily understood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>There are hundreds of pleasant cottages, many spacious
bungalows and not a few country mansions. These are dotted in
long picturesque lines by the shore of the Bay and on the cliffs that
follow the bend of the water. These houses are to the right and
left of the long road that runs from Point &agrave; Pic to the bridge at
Murray Bay River, on which street or roadway the village houses,
rented cottages and some of the hotels are placed. Many of the
bungalows have charming situations right on the water, with pleasant
gardens and decorative stone walls between main road and shore.
Others are embowered in the hilly land that follows the contour of
the Bay, where with breezy porches, enjoyable gardens and delightful
air, the roofs and gables are all that show from the lower
road. Rustic gates, zigzag steps up the grassy heights, handrails
of saplings with the bark unstripped, and arbour-covered terraces
or &lsquo;rests&rsquo; with shady seats on the way up, all mark the country-like
aspect of the surroundings.</p>
<p>There are many alluring drives in this neighborhood; few
anywhere can compare with them. A more romantic trip than that
to the Upper and Lower Falls of the Fraser River could hardly be
imagined. Leaving the carriage, exploring the wood and descending
into the ravine, a beautiful view is seen. The upper fall descends
in two drops to a depth of two hundred and ninety feet, and the
lower fall has a descent of one hundred and fifty feet. The Thou,
Chute, Desbiens, and the Nearn Fall with its salmon leap, are
favorite objectives for enjoyable driving excursions.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_72">
<img src="images/p0082.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="492" />
</div>
<p>The long wharf at Point &agrave; Pic is a bustling centre when
steamboats are coming in or going out. Rows of carriages are
backed in compact lines as far as the eye can see. It is almost
equally lively at night, and presents a gay sight with its strings of
electric light and clusters of summer people congregating on the
wharf to meet the coming and speed departing friends. Everyone
comes to see the boats arrive and depart. Furniture, cots, etc., are
being unloaded rapidly, and there, as a
box is passed ashore the strong electric
light shows it is addressed to&mdash;Cabot;
historic name! The busy scene on
steamer and wharf, the plash of the
water, the bustle of the moving carriages,
the long line of the pier thrown
out from the stern cliff, the beautiful
air and the fascination of a St. Lawrence
sunset with its fairy panorama of fantastic
cloud, silver tinted under the influence of the
rising moon&mdash;these things constitute a scene
that is truly delightful.</p>

</div>
<p>Owing to the fine drives in the
neighborhood, carriages are very numerous.
Almost every house of a <i>habitant</i>
has its stable, and whether he be a
grocer, a shoemaker or what not, his
<i>voiture</i> may be seen emerging from its lane by the trim little cottage
to meet every steamboat that calls at the wharf.</p>
<p>The life at Murray Bay is very pleasant; and it is sure to be
enjoyed by all who like driving, walking, boating, bathing, tennis,
golf, etc.; all of which recreations may be followed here to their full
in the midst of ideal surroundings.</p>
<p>Cap &agrave; l&rsquo;Aigle may be described as a farm-village resort.
It has a pleasant little strip of shale and gravel beach. It has a
waterfall, where, although the volume of water passing over it is
small, the view is very picturesque. Beach life is not prominent
in any of the Murray Bay resorts, unless it is at St. Ir&eacute;n&eacute;e.
This is because of the wonderful attraction the surrounding country
has for walks, drives, and other outdoor recreations. A few houses
cluster at the top of the road leading up from the wharf at Cap &agrave;
l&rsquo;Aigle, and farm houses extend along the tops of the cliffs in the
direction of St. Fid&egrave;le and St. Simeon.</p>
<p>There are numerous pleasant walks along the breezy heights,
and the road to Murray Bay River and village is an enjoyable
one. Cap &agrave; l&rsquo;Aigle has a quiet, restful, and simple life that suits it
for those who desire to spend the summer not too near to a town;
and in addition, it has the advantage of being within reasonable
distance of the busy summer centre at Murray Bay.</p>
<p>On the south shore of the St. Lawrence, almost opposite Cap
&agrave; l&rsquo;Aigle, lies bright and picturesque Kamouraska, with its white
houses lining the river, and its five verdant islands reposing within
convenient reach for the enjoyment of boating, bathing and fishing.
There are summer cottages here pleasantly placed along the banks,
and a number of stopping-places for visitors are found on the quiet
streets. Driving, walking, and tennis are the recreations, with the
usual social life found in country vacation centres. The village is
very prettily laid out; and the enjoyable stretches of beach, with
the abundant tree-growth of the neighborhood, make this a favorite
spot. Kamouraska is near the Intercolonial
Railway station of St. Paschal,
from which place it is reached by a
carriage drive of about six miles.</p>

</div>
<p>Rivi&egrave;re du Loup, some twenty-three
miles down the St. Lawrence
from Kamouraska, is a growing city of
considerable importance. It took its
name from the seals, once very numerous
by the mouth of the river. It has a pleasant situation on high land,
and on that account it has cool air. The long main street stretches continuously
to Fraserville, and follows the channel of the river for some
distance. It is a natural tourist centre; and the hotel accommodation
is good. The hotels at the Fraserville end are particularly suited
to those making a stay in the neighborhood; for some are large and
roomy, with nice gardens and a fine view of the river from the quiet
porches and balconies on the St. Lawrence side. There are pleasant
drives to Notre Dame du Portage village, Cacouna, etc.; and enjoyable
trips may be made over the lines of the Intercolonial and Temiscouata
Railways, as well as on the river in various directions. Lake Temiscouata,
or &lsquo;Winding Water,&rsquo; the Touladi River and Lake, the Madawaska,
or &lsquo;Never-Frozen&rsquo; River and the Acadian village of Edmundston
are all reached by going over the line of the Temiscouata Railway.
These places are all in the heart of a good fishing and hunting country.</p>
<p>At &lsquo;The Point&rsquo; on the river, numerous cottages have been built
for the enjoyment of cool river breezes, and here, too, good summer
hotels are found where gay companies spend happy days in boating
and other amusements. The wharf with its promenade 2,500 feet
long is a favorite spot at all times, and from this point the steamers
of the Trans St. Laurent Company leave for Tadousac and the
Saguenay, almost immediately opposite on the north shore some
twenty-five miles across.</p>
<p>The celebrated Falls of the Rivi&egrave;re du Loup are still beautiful,
although mills, etc., have made sad inroads on their beauty. They
are seen to best advantage by crossing the Intercolonial Railway
bridge and walking through the fields to a point down stream where
a high bank commands a full view of the river bed and the fall above.</p>
<p>Rivi&egrave;re du Loup is the centre of an interesting district; its
stores are very attractive, and its streets shady and well kept; while
the Fraserville district and the summer resorts of &lsquo;The Point&rsquo; affords
attractive opportunities for passing many a restful week in the summer
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
days. From this point, too, may be had one of the best views of the
north shore mountains found along the whole river.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_77">
<img src="images/p0087.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="412" />
<p class="caption">The Falls, Rivi&egrave;re du Loup</p>
</div>
<p>No more pleasant a way of reaching Tadousac and the world-famous
Saguenay River can be imagined than that enjoyed by taking
a steamer of the Trans St. Laurent Company from Rivi&egrave;re du Loup
wharf. It is a delightful trip of about two hours and a half, and it
is doubtful whether any other way of approaching the Saguenay gives
the pleasure and breadth of prospect that this commands.</p>
<p>Near where the steamboat lies at the starting wharf, great
three-masted merchantmen anchor to discharge and take on freight,
and tied up by the wharf itself huge steam barges receive their freight
of pulp wood for the U. S. A.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>As the crossing is made, numerous craft of all kinds come into
view. Boats, launches, barges, yachts, schooners, steamships, ocean
liners and naval vessels all pass by. The air is delightful and invigorating,
and the salt breeze from the ocean is both perceptible and
stimulating. The water is smooth, with just a gentle swell. There
is hardly a ripple to be seen, save here and there where without
apparent reason a tiny wavelet bursts on the surface and spreads
its milky froth around for a brief second or
two, and then becomes lost to the sight in
the general silvery calm that prevails. The
sky overhead is clear, while near the
horizon beautiful clouds of grey and
sun-lit white lend enchantment to the
distant mountain range on the north,
now drawing nearer and nearer and
gradually becoming distinguishable.
To the west a barge is crossing south, and its long trail of black smoke
reaches down to the Hare Islands where it mingles with the white
fleece of the cloud horizon and reflects a glint of sunshine over the
island slopes.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_79">
<img src="images/p0089.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="356" />
</div>
<p>To the far west the Allan liner that passed by an hour
before is mingling its smoke and vapor with that of the barge,
and building strange and fantastic castles in the air. To the east
Red Island looks like a long pontoon craft calmly sailing over
the waters. Before us the mountain range that erstwhile was dark,
and dimly visible, is now clearing and coming within view, and
shows light and shade of green fields and darker woodland.</p>
<p>As if by magic, the water has suddenly taken on a deep blue,
and the effect is to make the distant hills further off than they seemed
before. Now we pass through a river of molten silver, the wake
of a vessel that went by long ago. Gliding through, we reach a lake-like
expanse, cerulean in hue, and St. Catharines comes into view
over the bow of our vessel, with Tadousac beyond on the right.</p>
<p>We are now nearing the famous Saguenay, where the mariners
of ten centuries ago tarried after their long voyage to the &lsquo;Ultima
Thule&rsquo; of those remote days.</p>
<p>That which appeared to be a huge cloud bank over the rent
in the mountain range, where pours out the river in a mighty flood,
is now assuming form as a second and greater range beyond, dwarfing
more and more the high riparian hills into comparative insignificance.</p>
<p>But Tadousac is near, its grand prospect is spread out for our
gaze on every side, and we are making fast to a wharf in a romantic,
rocky cove&mdash;both wharf and cove presenting the appearance of having
dropped out of some picture-book in the clouds, so charming and
striking is the whole scene.</p>

<p class="caption">Tadousac</p>
</div>
<p>Tadousac was named by the native Montagnais Indians, the
word meaning mounds, or, as in this case, mountains. It has been
said that the village is placed like a nest in the midst of granite rocks
that surround the mouth of the Saguenay. It is built on a crescent-like
terrace, backed and flanked by mountains, and has a fine view
over the harbor, river, and distant shore of the St. Lawrence. The
whole life of the place is so tranquil and uncommercial that it does
not intrude on the visitor&rsquo;s pleasure. It does not follow from this
that there is an absence of life here&mdash;quite the contrary, for Tadousac
is a favorite resort of thousands; but what is meant is that throngs
are rarely seen on the streets or roads. A thousand people may arrive
on one of the great steamboats, and for a while a scene of activity
prevails at the wharf; but in a short time they disperse for the roads,
woods, lakes, park, shore and hotels, and soon the usual tranquility
prevails. There is nothing to mar the repose of the slumbering little
Chapel of the Jesuits on the heights; and its bell, over three centuries
old, still rings true. The Government Piscicultural Station, or salmon
hatchery, is beautifully placed and kept, overlooking the wharf and
rocky cove. Here the little creek Anse a l&rsquo;Eau makes out, and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
tiny waterfall, the lake, the platform walks, the summer house, and
climbing on the rocky slopes, attract many to a quiet enjoyment of
their beauties.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_81">
<img src="images/p0091.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="341" />
<p class="caption">Milking Time</p>
</div>
<p>Golf, tennis, walks, boating, etc., are the chief amusements,
and children find plenty of occupation playing on the fronting sand
beach, or in climbing the rocks and hills. There is a pleasant promenade
in front of the principal hotel. It faces south-east, commands one
of the noblest prospects ever seen, and is immediately above the beach
and open to the cool summer breeze. Summer houses or pergolas
dot the walk on the top of the cliff, and there is no lack of pleasant
walks in many directions. There are places where the first thought
on arrival is, &ldquo;how can I occupy my time?&rdquo; The thought that
immediately comes to mind here is, &ldquo;how can I see what is to be seen
here in a few days&mdash;a week&mdash;or a month?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The display of the Aurora Borealis is often magnificent in this
region. The Indians call this the reflection of the Camp Fires in the
Happy Hunting-Grounds. On a night when the sky is cloudless, and
brilliant with stars, it is a joyous experience to camp out. Possibly
there is just enough of a breeze to fan the flickering flame of the camp
fire. The broad expanse of the St. Lawrence is unruffled by a single
ripple, and as the gaze follows its surface the glorious stars are mirrored
like shining jewels. Looking to the mountains, great rays of white
shoot upward from behind their far-away heights. Stupendous arches
of purple mount into the blue sky, transient, evanescent; for soon the
dream-like fabric crumbles and disappears, to be followed by red or
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
crimson flames and a suffused glow as
of some cosmic conflagration in far-off
space.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_82">
<img src="images/p0092.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="248" />
</div>
<p>The white porpoise is hunted
with harpoons on the Saguenay and St.
Lawrence rivers. A length of fifteen
feet for this fish is not uncommon. They are not unlike the whale in
appearance and are often mistaken for their more unwieldy brother.
Much art is used to draw sufficiently near to make a good &lsquo;strike.&rsquo;
A boat with a white bottom has been used for this purpose, with a
wooden porpoise, or decoy, painted slate-color in imitation of the
young fish. Fenced enclosures, formed like a trap, are quite common
in many parts of the river. The fish enter, become confused in
seeking an outlet, and are easily caught when the tide lowers. Seals
are also caught in this locality, and even small whales are harpooned
at times.</p>
<p>A broad sand-bank reaches out into the St. Lawrence just a
short distance above the Saguenay. It is related that here a whale
was pursued by a swordfish. The fish, provided by nature with its
sharp weapon of offence, was chasing the unlucky whale, which moved
with great rapidity in the direction of the shore, making huge leaps
out of the water and giving out loud bellowing sounds as it sped along.
The whale was all of forty feet in length, and its enemy was fully
grown and must have measured twenty feet over all.</p>
<p>Confused by the near approach of its dread enemy, the whale
went too close to the sand-bar and was soon floundering about in
only ten feet of water. The swordfish now made off, possibly alarmed
by the tremendous splashing and the too-near approach to land. As
the tide was rapidly going out&mdash;it falls some eighteen feet here&mdash;there
was danger for the whale in being stranded high and dry.
It lashed out with its tail and churned the water with billowing
foam. At last after repeated rolls
towards deep water it got off,
and soon its joyful spouting could
be seen in the distance as it
escaped and made its way down
the Gulf.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_83">
<img src="images/p0092a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="343" />
</div>
<p>Seals are also caught with
the harpoon. To get near them
unperceived, Indians have made
holes in the sands at low tide.
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
Here they hide under a blanket and imitate the cry of the seal. The
seals down by the water&rsquo;s edge are attracted from their native element,
and gradually draw near. They make very slow progress on the land,
and when too far away to escape back to the water the Indians pounce
out and kill dozens with blows from their hatchets.</p>
<p>The Saguenay River is possibly the chief tributary of the
St. Lawrence. In every way it is remarkable. Deep, bold, and with
headlands of awful height, a trip over its waters from Tadousac to
Chicoutimi is an unique experience; for nowhere else can similar scenes
be found. The source of the river is in those streams that empty
into the head waters of Pikouagami, or Lake St. John, the principal
of which are the Peribonka and Mistassini rivers. The Metabetchouan,
an important stream, also flows into Lake St. John; and these
rivers with the Chicoutimi, Marguerite, Ha-Ha, and numerous smaller
rivers, all unite to swell the great flood of the almost bottomless
Saguenay. There are numerous lakes north and south of the river,
and, almost needless to state, the whole district abounds in mountain,
gorge, and waterfall scenery of the wildest kind. Tumultuous rapids
are everywhere; and the awful contrast with them of cloud-capped
mountain and the silent, still and deep, unfathomable water below
is almost overpowering.</p>
<p>It has been said of the Saguenay that it is not properly a river.
It is a tremendous chasm like that of the Jordan Valley and the Dead
Sea, cleft for sixty miles almost in a straight line through the heart
of a mountain wilderness. There is not a part of the river that does
not impress one with its grandeur and sublimity. The Indians, in
their usual direct nomenclature, called the river Saggishsekuss, &lsquo;a
river whose banks are precipitous&rsquo;; and from that name the more
pronounceable Saguenay has been derived. Jacques Cartier and
Champlain both sailed on this river, and tradition has it that Roberval
penetrated far inland and never returned.</p>
<p>Shallow water in the lower Saguenay must not be expected,
and even at the head of navigation a name is found that signifies
&lsquo;deep water.&rsquo; This is Chicoutimi, a delightful village where Scandinavian
vessels come to load up with lumber. Some claim that the
name of the village is derived from the Indian word Ishkotimew,
meaning &lsquo;up to here the water is deep.&rsquo; Be that as it may, it is a
picturesque place, where many of the cottages are roofed with birch-bark,
and where trim flower gardens, and cottage doors festooned
with climbing vines, may be seen. The dashing mountain stream
Chicoutimi, which has a wild descent of near 500 feet in seven miles,
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
enters the Saguenay just above the village, and
puts on a white bridal-fall in honor of its union
with the stern Saguenay.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_84">
<img src="images/p0094a.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="662" />
</div>
<p>On the way from Tadousac to Chicoutimi,
the mouth of the Marguerite River is passed.
This river is distant from Tadousac about 14
miles, and it has a beauty of its own claimed by
some to compare with that of the larger river,
but, of course, on a smaller scale. The scenery
is romantic in the extreme. Swirling eddies and
foaming rapids turn sharply around the high
cliffs, which are water-worn and smooth below from the action of
the dashing foam. Here and there are quiet pools, deep and silent;
and some are in almost perpetual shade from overhanging cliff and
woodland.</p>
<p>Some seventeen miles above stands Cape Eternity, with
Eternity Bay between it and the giant twin-brother Cape Trinity.
Many have felt that here the &lsquo;climax of the awe-inspiring scenery of
the Saguenay is reached.&rsquo; A huge wall of limestone here towers up
and projects boldly over the river. Those who pass beneath it give
a shudder of apprehension as they realize that a fall would mean
annihilation for all below. The great column has been likened to a
colossal stairway of three enormous treads, fit ascension to the clouds
for the giant gods of the early Indian&rsquo;s dream. Cape Eternity is
1700 feet high, and Cape Trinity 1500 feet. These enormous bulwarks
of rock are stern and grand in the awful majesty of their height and
power. As the eye soars upward, the pine-trees that have gained a
foothold in the fissures serve to accentuate the prodigious heights,
for onward and upward they loom until lost as specks of nothingness.</p>
<p>As Chicoutimi is gradually neared, the water of Ha-Ha Bay
opens up on the south. It received its odd name from the peals of
laughter indulged in by the early
French explorers who took it for the
main channel of the river, and who
found their mistake when they
reached the end of the cul-de-sac.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_85">
<img src="images/p0094b.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="394" />
</div>
<p>In and about Chicoutimi and
the neighboring villages are numerous
places of great interest; and
doubtless many who visit this district
will wish to go part or all the way to
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
Lake St. John for the pleasure of returning by canoe, and of enjoying
the lively sport of shooting the rapids in care of two skilful Indian
guides. At Portage de l&rsquo;Enfant an Indian child managed to perform
a feat that few could be likely to imitate successfully: that of going
over the 50-foot fall in a canoe, and escaping uninjured. For lovers
of the curious, the church at Chicoutimi contains an ancient bell with
an inscription on it that no one has been able to decipher.</p>
<p>If so minded, the traveller who finds himself in this delightful
district may go by rail from Chicoutimi to Roberval at the south-western
end of Lake St. John. Here, in more open country, another
series of excursions may be had, and, not forgetting the pleasure of a
stay at Roberval as a centre, those who are fond of steamboat trips,
driving, walking, boating and canoeing may go in many directions.</p>
<p>The steamboat trip from Roberval to the Grand Discharge
and &lsquo;Thousand Isles of the Saguenay&rsquo; is a favorite one. There is
nothing similar to it elsewhere. The drives to Ouiatchouan Falls,
picturesque and nearly 300 feet high, and the Montagnais village of
Pointe Bleue are full of interest and novelty. Many other trips are
possible.</p>
<p>Much of the country to the north of the lake is unexplored.
The same remark applies to the rivers of the northern district, or
rather to their upper waters. Across Lake St. John, therefore, is
ground where the experienced huntsman or nature-lover may find
ample occupation in new fields.</p>
<p>The happy sojourner in these regions will soon become
accustomed to the Indian names, and, if the use of &lsquo;fire-water&rsquo; is
eschewed, words like Chamouchouan and Ashuapmouchouan will roll
trippingly from the tongue.</p>
<p>And now for an Indian legend. Tonadalwa was an Indian maid
beautiful to look upon, and desired by every young brave of her
tribe. Her eyes were dark and lustrous, her form was lithe, supple
and beautifully moulded, words from her lips were sweeter than
honey, and her song was like unto that of the bird that soars joyously
in the sky at the first flush of the rosy dawn.</p>
<p>Tonadalwa&rsquo;s heart had never quickened its tender fluttering
under the glances of her dusky wooers. One only, Po-kwa-ha, had
any place in her affections. He had saved her from drowning, years
before, and it filled her memory. In a canoe as light as a feather,
that her lover had made for her, and with the stroke she had learned
from him, she would take her way over the water, skimming the
white-crested waves with a grace and speed beautiful to behold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>

<div class="img" id="pic_87">
<img src="images/p0097a.jpg" alt="" width="359" height="600" />
</div>
<p>One day as the soft summer air played
languidly in and out of the quivering tree
branches, while the sun poised over the horizon
and assumed its dying robe of crimson, Tonadalwa&rsquo;s
canoe glided out from the village shore
and took its way down the great river. Taking
only an occasional stroke to keep in mid-channel,
the maiden floated on. The faint musical
ripple of the gliding canoe and the gentle swish
of the paddle made a fitting accompaniment
for girlish fancies that lightly came and went
on the wings of thought, and soon the soul of
Tonadalwa was deep in communion with
nature, and her paddle rested motionless over the water.</p>
<p>But a sound from the shore interrupts her reverie. She listens.
Yes, it is her lover&rsquo;s voice. He calls her, as he has done before. She
waits to see if his canoe puts out, but it does not. Again his voice
is heard, and, this time quickly immersing her paddle, she speeds for
the shore. But it is a cruel ruse of a rejected suitor, for when too late
she sees the hated brave dash out in his canoe, and the thing she has
dimly dreaded from the evil glance of Ka-wis is about to happen.
She screams and turns to flee. The dastard brave drops his paddle,
springs to his feet, and, knowing that the maiden will escape in her
light canoe, sends an arrow on its deadly errand of revenge. But
Tonadalwa&rsquo;s eye was quick and her action fleet, for she dropped
prostrate ere the arrow sped where she had stood a moment before.
Alas! she had lost her paddle in the quick movement, and as she
drifted down, not daring to look up, she soon heard the roar of the
dreaded fall below.</p>
<p>All too soon she realized her peril. A cry now reaches her ear.
The cry rings true this time, her heart tells her, and, springing up, she
looks to the bank, sees that Ka-wis has fled
and that her brave Po-kwa-ha is running
rapidly as he tries to overtake her. Ere he
can draw near to take the plunge of desperation
and love, the whirling eddies have
caught the Indian maid in their grasp, the
seething rapids toss her canoe from billow to
billow, and Death seizes her in his cold
embrace as the frail bark is dashed over
the foaming cataract.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_88">
<img src="images/p0097b.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="603" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Po-kwa-ha sees the dreadful catastrophe, as for one brief
moment the beloved form of Tonadalwa is outlined clearly against
the evening sky; and then, with one last involuntary cry for help,
she extends her arms to her lover&mdash;and she has gone.</p>
<p>With his loved one torn from his very grasp, with despair in his
heart, and all desire for life extinguished at one stroke, the poor lover
rushes madly to the brink and plunges over the cataract to his death.</p>
<p>But the Good Manitou is kind to the brave, the good, the pure,
and the true; shadowy forms, spirits of dead braves, rise from the
foaming depths below, and ere the hungry waters can overwhelm
the Indian maid, she is borne up, rescued, and returned to life.</p>
<p>Nor was the lover to meet the death he sought; for the same arm
that had rescued the maiden now held up the form of the young
brave, and placing her in his arms, Tonadalwa and Po-kwa-ha were
united in life; and, bearing her tenderly to her home and safety,
they were soon united in happy matrimony amidst the rejoicing of
the whole tribe.</p>
<p>Ka-wis was seen no more. When he shot the arrow, he, too,
lost his paddle, and was swept over the dreaded falls. As he sank
in the terrible abyss below no pitying spirits upbore him, and Death
claimed him as its own.</p>
<p>As we make our way back to Chicoutimi and towards the St.
Lawrence, we cannot fail to be impressed by some of the amazing
features of the Saguenay River. By actual soundings many parts
of the river are over one thousand feet in depth, and none are less
than one hundred feet. In places it is as deep five feet from the shore
as in the middle of the channel. To boat or canoe on such waters
and in the midst of such majestic and sublime surroundings is the
one thrilling experience of a lifetime. The stoutest heart must pay
involuntary homage to nature when gliding beneath boldly over-hanging
masses of rock that must weigh millions of tons.</p>
<p>In addition to such scenes, there are softer effects that appeal
to all lovers of the beautiful. Picture the scene when on a fine, clear
day, with just a gauzy haze on the topmost heights of the cliffs, a
boat passes out of the shadows into the full light of the beaming sun.
The blue smoke wreathing gently upwards is from an Indian encampment
just behind yon hill. Here are fine salmon leaping bodily out
of the water; above is a soaring eagle showing like a mere speck against
the sun, while on the surface of the water seals are showing their
dog-like heads and lazy porpoises are playfully spouting sparkling
fountains of spray.</p>

<p>The oldest and purest Indian dialect is that of the Montagnais,
or &lsquo;mountaineers.&rsquo; They were the original inhabitants of those sky-reaching
regions, but of late they have gradually retired in the direction
of Hudson&rsquo;s Bay. Indian dialects, as a rule, are very musical, and the
manner in which Indians in general express themselves is full of poetry
and imagery. Most of the legends that have survived of these people
are grotesque in character&mdash;of the Glooscap kind. The romantic
tales and fancies will soon be lost unless some effort is made to gather
and preserve them.</p>
<p>But the line of the Intercolonial Railway sends a strong call
from the opposite St. Lawrence shore, and severing present connection
with all the attractions of Tadousac and the Saguenay and Lake
St. John district, Rivi&egrave;re du Loup is regained and the journey north-east
is resumed.</p>
<p>A drive of between two and three miles from the railway station
at Cacouna leads to the pleasant resort of that name.</p>
<p>Cacouna has been called the Brighton of Canada, its bathing
on smooth beach, tennis, boating, walking and driving attracting
many here to spend the whole summer. It is a dangerous place for
bachelors, so great is the display of youth and beauty. In the words
of the French-Canadian gradually mastering the intricacies of the
English language:</p>

<p>There are many pretty cottages of summer
residents along the high and wooded banks, and there is plenty of
accommodation at the hotels and boarding places. Pleasant excursions
are enjoyed to the nearby lake in the hills, as well as along
the country and river roads, and there are enjoyable drives to St.
Ars&egrave;ne and St. Modeste. The view of the St. Lawrence from the
heights is very beautiful, and the air is cool and pleasant. The
sunset views enjoyed here are famous. The quiet and enjoyable

</div>
<p>The name of the village is Indian, and signifies &lsquo;the turtle,&rsquo;
from the shape of the great mass of rock connected to the mainland
here by a low isthmus.</p>
<p>Passing Isle Verte, the old village of Trois Pistoles is reached.
A very pretty fishing-river, with tributaries, is here; and summer
cottages have been built for the enjoyment of the fine scenery and
good air. A beautiful church interior may be seen in this quiet
village. The church is near the centre of the village and is known as
Notre Dame des Neiges, or &lsquo;Our Lady of the Snows.&rsquo; To see it is
worth a trip of hundreds of miles. The village itself is quaint, and
full of old-time atmosphere.</p>
<p>Who was it exclaimed, &ldquo;I wish I were Queen of Bic!&rdquo; and in
that short sentence expressed a just appreciation of all the beauties
in which this district abounds? Along Alpine heights the Intercolonial
Railway takes its way, and the approach, far and near, is exquisite
for the varied and magnificent panorama of scenery. At one point
the train threads a mountain gorge hundreds of feet in the air, and,
as it winds along, most charming kaleidoscopic effects are displayed
to the admiring gaze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Long years ago an old inn existed by the wayside, in
connection with which gruesome tales are told of travellers and their
strange disappearance. The village was originally known as Pic.
Jacques Carrier entered and named the harbor Islet St. Jean. At
one time it was intended to make it a harbor for French war vessels,
and to make it a grand outpost in the general scheme for the defense
of Quebec. A long wharf into deep water is now under construction.</p>
<p>Bic is just the place for those who do not care for town life at
the shore. The village is very interesting and well situated, and
there are many good walks through varied and picturesque country.
The land-locked bay is very pleasant at high tide. At the outlet
there is a wharf and a cluster of summer cottages. The new wharf
for steamers of deep draught leads right under frowning cliffs, the
points of which have been blasted away to give room for the new
construction. Here the general scene is bold and striking, and the
water view is very pleasing. The cottages are well placed for those
who would enjoy a quiet vacation amidst pleasant surroundings.</p>
<p>Hattee Bay nearby has a fine stretch of sand, with a few
bungalows on the overlooking heights.</p>
<p>A story of massacre has caused one of the Bic islands to be
named &lsquo;L&rsquo;Islet au Massacre,&rsquo; or Massacre Island, from a terrible
deed of blood that took place in a cave there. It is related by M.
Tach&ecirc; in the &lsquo;Soir&eacute;es Canadiennes&rsquo;:&mdash;Two hundred Micmac Indians
were camping there for the night; the canoes had been beached and
a neighboring recess or cavern in the lofty rocks which bound the
coast offered an apparently secure asylum to the warriors, their
squaws and papooses. Wrapped in sleep, the redskins quietly
awaited the return of day to resume their journey; they slept, but
not their lynx-eyed enemy, the Iroquois; from afar, he had scented
his prey. During the still hours of night, his silent steps had compassed
the slumbering foe. Laden with birch-bark fagots and other
combustible materials, the Iroquois noiselessly surround the cavern;
the fagots are piled around it, the torch applied. Kohe! Kohe!
Hark! the fiendish well-known warwhoop! The Micmacs, terror-stricken,
seize their arms; they prepare to sell dearly their lives,
when the lambent flames and the scorching heat leave them but one
alternative, that of rushing from their lurking place.</p>
<p>One egress alone remains; wild despair steels their hearts;
men, women and children crowd through the narrow passage amidst
the flames; at the same instant a shower of poisoned arrows decimates
them; the human hyena is on his prey. A few flourishes of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
tomahawk from the Iroquois, and the
silence of death soon invades the narrow
abode.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_93">
<img src="images/p0104.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="387" />
</div>
<p>Now for the trophies; the scalping,
it seems, took some time to be done
effectually.</p>
<p>History mentions but five, out of
the two hundred victims, who escaped
with their lives.</p>
<p>The blanched bones of the Micmac braves strewed the cavern,
and could be seen until some years back.</p>
<p>Those who escaped travelled day and night to reach a large
Huron camp some distance away. A rapid march was then made
by the whole Huron force to the track by which the Iroquois would
return. Not expecting an attack the Iroquois were in turn taken
by surprise, and tradition has it that they were slaughtered to a
man.</p>
<p>The pleasures of Bic are not exhausted by the recounting of
its water-joys, air, scenery and social life. The walks and drives
are a grand feature of summer existence, and moreover they are
full of variety. How delightful to take a river drive in either
direction. Possibly a walk is preferred, and, with a swinging step
adapted to a six or seven mile excursion, a start is made in the direction
of the bridge over the South-West River. Passing up the long
main street, the varied character of the buildings is noticeable; and
the quaint and foreign appearance causes the walk to be arrested
at many a spot. Towering woodland heights on the left, beautiful
islands on the right and haze-capped sugar-loaf mountains before,
it is not long before street merges into country lane. Soon are
passed the clustering cottages and gardens, and neat-appearing
farms are at hand. Here where the Intercolonial Railway is high
up on an observation terrace cut in the side of the mountain, the
country road leads down hill, and, with many a pleasurable incident
on the further way, and an occasional English-French chat with
the <i>habitants</i>, the bridge is reached.</p>
<p>But dark clouds begin to build up moist tire-laden pyramids,
and low rumblings of distant thunder are beginning to be heard. A
St. Lawrence thunderstorm in this mountainous locality is a thunderstorm,
and when it rains, it rains. Right-about-face&mdash;Quick, March!
and off we go. A few miles are covered, but the storm is imminent.
Several <i>cartiers</i> pass uttering their monotonous and plaintive cry,
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
&ldquo;<i>Marche donc</i>&rdquo;&mdash;a sort of querulous question, &lsquo;why don&rsquo;t you go
on?&rsquo; addressed to their patient horses. You decline the oft-repeated
proffer of a ride&mdash;and a wetting&mdash;and execute a double-quick run
for the shelter of a friendly cottage. Your energetic knock is quickly
answered by a young girl of seventeen summers who has in her engaging
face all the sweet characteristics of the daughters of France.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I shelter here until the storm has passed,&rdquo; you ask,
stepping in. &ldquo;<i>Pardon, Monsieur?</i>&rdquo; comes the reply, as the door is
hastily closed against the pelting rain.</p>
<p>Your linguistic powers are varied, yet limited; having been
acquired by brief residences in four or five different countries. You
manage to remark, &ldquo;<i>Un jour de pluie</i>,&rdquo; and as the young girl smiles
indulgently over this very obvious fact, while rain dashes against
the window,&mdash;lightning flashing and thunder rolling&mdash;you manage
to explain &ldquo;<i>un abri</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Avec plaisir, Monsieur</i>,&rdquo; is the reply in liquid
and sweet intonation.</p>
<p>Removing your rain-coat you gratefully repose in the solid
arm-chair, and examine with keen interest all the fittings, ornaments
and family souvenirs of what you plainly see is an old-time French
interior. Your amiable hostess has gone for a moment, but soon
reappears, followed by father, mother, grandfather, brother and
sister. You rise, bow politely, and shake hands all round, not forgetting
your &lsquo;good angel of the storm,&rsquo; whose ingenuous eyes reflect
the pleasure of having a visitor from the outer world. &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est un
grand plaisir</i>,&rdquo; you remark; and then indicating her, you add, &ldquo;<i>Ma
bonne ange de l&rsquo;orage</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this all laugh heartily, and none more so than <i>&lsquo;la bonne
ange&rsquo;</i> herself. &ldquo;I hev bin in de State,&rdquo; the oldest, a son, remarks,
as all the family smile proudly over his knowledge of English. The
elder daughter now invites you to sit near her on the settee while
she leafs over the album of family portraits for your entertainment.
You are immediately surrounded by the others; all leaning over,
pointing out the portraits and relating choice bits of family history.
Everyone talks at once, and your frail linguistic bark founders in
the deep sea of voluble conversation.</p>
<p>And now a blinding flash of lightning is followed immediately
by a tremendous crash of thunder. The house is shaken by the
concussion. &lsquo;<i>La Bonne Ange</i>&rsquo; quickly runs to the old-fashioned
cupboard in the corner, takes out a bottle and sprinkles <i>l&rsquo;eau benite</i>
over the door lintel and window frame. Her sister having run
out of the room after the alarming thunder-peal, &lsquo;<i>La Bonne Ange</i>&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
shares your settee and explains that the little
ceremony she has just performed is to keep
lightning out of the room. She goes out and
brings back a French-English conversation
lexicon. She turns to one of the sentences
arranged in parallel columns, speaks the
French and asks you to pronounce the English.
This done, you exchange; she speaks
the English and you speak the French&mdash;each
correcting the pronunciation of the other until
both are right. The others look on eagerly,
and smile encouragement over your progress. Every time you speak
without the necessity for correction, all cry out delightedly, &ldquo;<i>Oui,
Oui, Monsieur</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_94">
<img src="images/p0106a.jpg" alt="" width="380" height="499" />
</div>
<p>At last &lsquo;<i>La Bonne Ange</i>&rsquo; closes the book, and makes you
understand that without looking at it you are to address her in
French.</p>
<p>The thunder has ceased, the clouds have passed, and the
returning light illumines the room and the kindly faces about you.
A golden sunbeam casts an aureole around the head of &lsquo;<i>La Bonne
Ange</i>,&rsquo; and turning to her you say, &ldquo;<i>Vous etes tres jolie, mademoiselle</i>!&rdquo;
A peal of happy laughter from the family greets your remark, followed
by a clapping of hands; and as she looks down demurely,
&lsquo;<i>La Bonne Ange</i>&rsquo; replies, &ldquo;<i>Vous parlez fran&ccedil;ais tres bien, Monsieur</i>;&rdquo;
at which we all laugh more heartily than before.</p>
<p>You rise to go, expressing your thanks for shelter the while.
A kind and hearty invitation to remain and sup is given; but this
you reluctantly decline, explaining that duty calls you away by
the evening train. All press around to bid you good-bye, and as
you leave and turn the bend of the road all the members of the
family salute you from the porch with waving hands, while in their
midst, fluttering her handkerchief, stands &lsquo;<i>La Bonne Ange de l&rsquo;Orage</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Proceeding down the St. Lawrence, St. Germain de Rimouske,
or Rimouski, is reached, a thriving town and pleasant
summer resort, with good hotels, a fine river and attractive
scenery. The beach at Sacr&eacute; Coeur, a few
miles away, is a good one. There is a fine
Government wharf here. Father Point, a
&lsquo;Wireless&rsquo; station and place of call for large
ocean-going vessels, may be reached from
here, or from the next station, St. Anaclet,
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
on the Intercolonial Railway. Passing Ste. Flavie, from which a
short connecting railroad runs to M&eacute;tis Beach, Matane and Matane-Sur-Mer,
and going by St. Octave with its fine fall on the Grand
M&eacute;tis River, the station of Little M&eacute;tis is reached, from which a
drive of about six miles terminates at the well-known St. Lawrence
resort, M&eacute;tis Beach.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_96">
<img src="images/p0107.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="411" />
<p class="caption">On the Links, Metis Beach</p>
</div>
<p>This delightful watering-place with its combined charm of
country and shore is a favorite summer place for all who love quiet
and restful surroundings, with walks and drives in a country that is
full of interest. It has been termed the &lsquo;Bride&rsquo;s Mecca&rsquo; or nearest
mundane approach to the groves of paradise. It is one of those
nice spots favored by people of quiet tastes and avoided by lovers
of glare and noise.</p>
<p>Boating, bathing, golf, tennis, walking and driving, are the chief
amusements. There is also an enjoyable social life. The summer
cottages are delightfully situated, being almost hidden in the trees:
each has its own outlook over the broad St. Lawrence, here some
forty miles wide. The Golf Links are most beautifully situated amidst
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
ideal surroundings. The hotels are right on the water, with plenty
of shade from the generous tree-growth so noticeable in this district.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_97">
<img src="images/p0108.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="410" />
<p class="caption">On the River, Matane</p>
</div>
<p>The beach, one of the best along the St. Lawrence shore, is
not used as much as it should be. It is of pebble and sand, with
clusters of rock that have fallen from the bold cliff. A very romantic
waterfall cascades through a rocky defile and falls on to the beach
near one of the principal hotels of the resort; and this waterfall&mdash;so
accessible, so enticing&mdash;is surely one of the most charming pictures
that could possibly be imagined. After it reaches the beach it
courses down over the pebbles in miniature rapids and foaming
rills. No greater fun for children could be found than that of wading
in the dashing and sparkling streams that make their way down the
beach and out into the salt St. Lawrence.</p>
<p>Rambling along the beach here, under the shade of the trees,
is very enjoyable; and rocky knolls with nooks and shelters are
conveniently near.</p>
<p>About eighteen miles down the river, Matane-Sur-Mer is
reached, a very pleasant spot that has recently been opened up by
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
a short railroad that connects with the Intercolonial Railway at
Ste. Flavie. Near the lighthouse, and the lighthouse-keeper&rsquo;s
cheerful home adjoining, bungalows and cottages are being built
on a nicely-wooded elevation that overlooks a long strip of pebble
beach. It commands a fine view of the broad St. Lawrence, and
is a good situation for those who like perfect rest and quiet.</p>
<p>A very enjoyable walk leads to the river Matane, at the
mouth of which the bright and busy village of Matane is placed.
Large lumber shipments are made here, and the place promises to
grow steadily as the St. Lawrence lower coast trade develops. Matane
stands on a well-chosen site, and it has good facilities for bathing,
boating, etc. There are many fine views from the surrounding
heights, and the walks in and about the village, as well as in the
adjacent country, are very enjoyable.</p>

<div class="img" id="pic_99">
<img src="images/p0111a.jpg" alt="" width="673" height="688" />
</div>
<p>Saying &lsquo;Good-bye&rsquo; to the hospitable
shore of the St. Lawrence, and with
mind well stored with pleasant memories
of happy days and joyous hours, a course
across the base of the Gasp&eacute; Peninsula
is now taken by the line of the Intercolonial
Railway, which here makes a
south-easterly dip to reach Matapedia at
the head of the Baies de Chaleurs.</p>
<p>Regaining Little M&eacute;tis station a
good view of interesting country is obtained on the way to
Kempt. Mountain ranges rise on each side, with high table land,
bold slopes, and lines of hills running off to the north. The woods
are beautiful, the white birches brightening up the various shades of
forest green. Beyond Kempt the hills broaden out at times into
wide plains marked by gentle undulations of rich green. Rocky
cuttings, protected by high snow-fences, are passed, and soon a well-defined
valley is reached that is quite narrow in places. At the left,
for some distance, runs the river. Other rocky cuttings are entered,
beyond which another valley, with the still-flowing river, is reached,
After passing the little lumbering village of St. Moise the road again
leads through the hills; higher and higher, with dense forest on every
hand, and soon it is necessary to cut through
their very midst.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_100">
<img src="images/p0111b.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="652" />
</div>
<p>At Sayabec the region of beautiful Lake
Matapedia is reached, and at Cedar Hall is the
most convenient stopping-place for seeing the
lake and its scenery. Together with Amqui
and Lac au Saumon these places are small
lumbering centres. They all have fine surroundings,
but the district has not been fully
opened up, and only moderate accommodation
can be found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>The course now leads by the murmuring Matapedia River, and
at Causapscal is found an ideal spot for a restful vacation. It is only
suited for those who have quiet tastes and a love for the beautiful,
or for those who can enjoy woodland and river walks. It is
one of the most beautiful and restful little spots ever seen. It is a
picture from Switzerland, and more. No matter how extended the
journey, a stay of a few days should be made at Causapscal to
drink in some of its soothing balm.</p>
<p>The Matapedia courses right through the village&mdash;one of the
cleanest in all Quebec, by the way&mdash;and one may stop at a comfortable
little hostelry, look right out on the river just across the highway,
and be lulled to calm slumber by its gentle murmur. Here the houses
are built only on one side of the road, and this gives a pleasant view
of grassy sward and rippling stream from any part of the village.
There are fine views on every hand. The Causapscal River unites
with the beautiful Matapedia quite nearby, and along the banks
of both streams many choice walks may be enjoyed.</p>
<p>The junction of the two rivers is between high banks, and here
is a favorite fishing-haunt for those who own the fishing rights. The
Matamajaw Salmon Club House is on the top of the bank, close by.</p>
<p>Beau Rivage is a peaceful hamlet, framed by the far-reaching
hills that are here broadened out to a considerable extent. Those
who would see the beauties of the famed Matapedia Valley will find
ample occupation as the train speeds along.</p>
<p>The Matapedia, or &lsquo;Musical&rsquo; River, flows along with soothing
murmur and sings a song of peace the while. The rows of cedar logs
piled high on the bank, for shipment over the railroad, are turning
grey under the summer sun and they blend harmoniously in the
landscape effect. Flowers are springing up everywhere, and the tall
lambkill is beautiful to behold. How glorious is the country with its
absence of formalism and inane repetition of stereotyped patterns!
Here the river narrows and throws up two long islands of white and
grey pebbles. The water, confined to small channels for the time,
dashes forward and springs up, leaping and foaming. How joyful
its music! The course now bends suddenly, just where the current
is foaming and descending in a noisy rapid. The clear water breaks
in rippling waves of snow-white foam, and passes in well-marked
ridges for some distance, until the widening channel permits it to
resume its erstwhile tranquil way.</p>
<p>Now it passes under the shade of a high and beautifully-wooded
mountain, and immediately the water is tinged with a darkening
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
shade&mdash;the sun eclipsed by the overhanging trees. On many of
the mountains so thick is the foliage that not one tree-trunk can be
seen uncovered, excepting, here and there, a white birch sapling.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_101">
<img src="images/p0113.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="414" />
<p class="caption">Restigouche Valley</p>
</div>
<p>The scenery of the river and valley between Assametquaghan
and Glen Emma is particularly bold and grand, and most enchanting
views of the winding Matapedia meet the gaze at every turn of its
sinuous course. The mountains rise higher and higher, and as the train
turns in and out, far-away glimpses of the silvery stream are frequently
caught. Just below the railroad a mass of rocks has fallen from the
mountain side into the bed of the river, almost closing the way.
Leaning out of the window, as we slow up, the spray is almost at hand.</p>
<p>At times the stream broadens considerably, and the mountains
run to foot-hills that diminish to gentle slopes at the river&rsquo;s brink.
Looking along the valley at such points, a grand panorama of mountain,
hill, dale, valley and winding stream enchants the artistic eye. There
a long line of beautiful trees is seen on an islet, once part of the mainland.
As the train goes down stream the island seems to come up
under full sail to meet it; and all around, in valley, on mound and hill,
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
and up the steep sides of the mountains,
the gorgeous pink bloom of
the prolific rhododendron gives joy
to the senses.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_102">
<img src="images/p0114.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="399" />
</div>
<p>Here the Matapedia has
changed its pebble bed for one of
rock, and as there is a considerable
fall,&mdash;which is also quite noticeable
on account of the easy running of
the train&mdash;the churning waves and
dashing foam show beautifully below.
At a point where the stream deepens and flows on with darker
hue and unruffled surface the train crosses again to the left bank
and approaches Millstream&mdash;the smallest of hamlets in the most
ideal situation that could well be imagined.</p>
<p>On the shore of the river, not far away, is an encampment of
happy vacationists, with tent, and shack for cooking; their boat
moored below, and the stream singing of health and cool summer
joys as it dashes gaily by.</p>
<p>The village of Matapedia has a choice and romantic situation
at the confluence of the Matapedia and Restigouche Rivers, known as
&lsquo;the meeting of the waters.&rsquo; A railroad runs from here along the south
shore of the Gasp&eacute; Peninsula. The surrounding country is magnificent,
and a wealth of beauty is found in the river scenery and fine
walks of the neighborhood. It is one of the choice spots of Canada, and
numerous sites for cottage retreats and river bungalows will be found
along the valley of the Matapedia River, above and below the village.</p>
<p>The canoeing waters of this lovely district are exceedingly
choice.</p>
<p>Very nearly all of the country traversed hitherto has been rich
in rivers and streams. In addition to the great inland sea of the
St. Lawrence, and all the numerous rivers previously named, the
district bordered by the Matapedia River has excellent water privileges
that cover a wide area. That fine river, the Rimouski, and the
charming little Neigette are within easy reach of the M&eacute;tis River,
indeed the smaller river runs into the M&eacute;tis; and the M&eacute;tis itself
is almost touched by the Patapedia which runs on and connects with
the Restigouche and Matapedia Rivers.</p>
<p>Rich as Quebec is in watercourses, the province of New
Brunswick, into which we are about to pass, is endowed to even a more
extraordinary extent with those supreme additions to the beauty of
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
a landscape; and which provide, when communicating, such pleasant
and convenient means for going from one part of the country to the
other.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_103">
<img src="images/p0115.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="414" />
<p class="caption"><b>Matapedia, Looking over the Restigouche River</b></p>
</div>
<p>The system of nearly-connecting rivers just traced extends
through New Brunswick in a wonderful manner; for over the Upsalquitch,
Nepisiguit, Miramichi and other rivers, and by means of the
Madawaska and Tobique, and over the widely ramifying waters of
the noble St. John, a grand highway of water travel is provided. In
addition, there is an almost countless number of tributary streams
that intersect the country in every direction, and which serve to
bring remote inner districts into communication with the seaboard.
As has been seen, some of the rivers are very rapid&mdash;dashing headlong
through rocky gorges and over stony beds. Others are wide and
tranquil, and some ripple a quiet way over sandy beds.</p>
<p>Nor must the myriad streams of smaller proportions be forgotten&mdash;the
cascade, the brook, the clear and sparkling waters where
fish abound. Surely the whole of this beautiful country is that of
which the poet of olden days wrote:</p>

</div>
<p>The Matapedia, or &lsquo;Musical,&rsquo; River received its name from
the sound made by the wind in the branches of the trees as it courses
over and through the numerous ravines. The river rises in Lake
Matapedia, and is over sixty miles long. Its principal tributaries are
the Causapscal and the Kassimiguagan. It runs a rapid course
between two extensive mountain ranges, and terminates in the
Restigouche at a point some twenty miles south-west of Matapedia
village.</p>
<p>Along the Tobique River are mountains and mountain ranges
of great beauty. Bald Head, on the Riley Brook, near the Northern
Forks, is nearly 2,300 feet above sea-level. The Blue Mountains
of the Tobique Valley are very picturesque&mdash;some rise as high as
1,200 feet above the river level. The loftiest heights are attained
on the south branch of the Nepisiguit, between Nictor and Nepisiguit
Lakes and the eastern branch of the Tobique. Here a height is attained
of 2,600 feet above the sea-level. There are several odd-looking
mountains on the portage from Nepisiguit River to Upsalquitch Lake,
and a good view of the surrounding country is obtained by climbing
one of these heights.</p>
<p>The Tobique is considered by many to be the most picturesque
stream in all New Brunswick. The fishing is fine and the scenery
beautiful. Nictor Lake is well worth the journey necessary to reach
it, and the whole trip up and down the river is a unique woodland
and water experience. Near the high land separating the Tobique
waters from those of the Miramichi and Nepisiguit, the highest lakes
of New Brunswick are found, many of them being over 1,200 feet
above the level of the sea. The whole province abounds in lakes.
Those off the regular travel routes are seldom visited, although they
are quite attractive.</p>
<p>The Restigouche has been called the &lsquo;noblest salmon river of
the world.&rsquo; It is navigable for 130 miles or more above Campbellton.
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
It has bold and rugged shores as well as scenes of softer beauty. The
country on both sides of the river is exceedingly grand and impressive.
There are huge lofty mountains, often of irregular shape, covered with
tall pines and rich hardwood. Its chief tributaries are the Matapedia,
the Upsalquitch, the Patapedia, and the Quatawamkedgewick, or
&lsquo;Tom Kedgewick.&rsquo; The head waiters are within fifteen miles of the St.
John, and that river may be reached by canoe with a portage of only
three miles along the Grand River connection.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_105">
<img src="images/p0118.jpg" alt="" width="611" height="500" />
<p class="caption">The Meeting of the Waters</p>
</div>
<p>The length of the Restigouche is over 200 miles. It flows
generally over a north-east course, and broadens gradually as it
nears its mouth at the Bay of Chaleur. It is the first large river to
be met that is entirely free of rapid and fall not practicable for a canoe.
It is full of windings and abrupt turns which add to the beauty of
its scenery, and where pools are so often found in which fish like to
lie. There are places where the flow of the water is so tranquil that
it can hardly be noticed. Others there are where gay and frothy little
rapids bubble and dance as they toss their white crests in the air,
but here a canoe may be poled through with ease. Even in those
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
places where swirling eddies and foaming
waters are found, little difficulty is
experienced in making a way through
to the quiet water above. In the quiet
and still parts of the river the fish are
to be seen swimming about many feet
below the surface, and this is true, also,
of the Green River, which connects with
the upper forks of the Restigouche.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_106">
<img src="images/p0119.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="387" />
</div>
<p>The Upsalquitch is a stream of many tributaries and sparkling
branches. It abounds in salmon and trout. It is related that on one
journey over this river the fish were so plentiful that considerable
effort was necessary to force a way through with the canoe. On
another trip down to the Restigouche a pool was passed through
where not less than two hundred salmon jumped and darted in every
direction when they were thus disturbed. These fish would only
average about twenty pounds each; but others weighing over forty
pounds are frequently caught.</p>
<p>From Campbellton over the line of the International Railway
to St. Leonard&rsquo;s, many districts of the Upsalquitch, Kedgewick,
Restigouche, Tobique and St. John Rivers may be reached.</p>
<p>The Nepisiguit, or &lsquo;River of Foaming Waters,&rsquo; is a fine fishing
stream. But great as this attraction is, it has even a greater, for its
scenery is rugged, romantic and exquisitely varied. The picturesque
Pabineau Fall is a lovely sight, and the Grand Falls of the Nepisiguit,
about twenty miles from Bathurst, should be seen by every one.
Connection is made by a short railroad with the line of the
Intercolonial Railway at Nepisiguit Junction, near Bathurst. The
Grand Falls tumble precipitately in four descents through a huge
rocky gorge. The roar of the water, the foaming curtain of the descending
torrent and the spray that floats some distance down&mdash;all
combine to make a striking scene; while the sight of the river rolling
away in the shuddering depths below has a strong fascination for
all. Above the Grand Falls there are picturesque rapids where by
walking over the great rocks&mdash;and over giant tree trunks that
have lodged in immovable positions in their descent of the river from
the lumbering region higher up&mdash;a good view of river and hilly banks
may be obtained. By going down the railroad for about one quarter
of a mile, and climbing up on to a bluff, a full view of the gorge,
the fall and the foaming depths far below may be had.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Pabineau Fall takes its name indirectly
from the small stream Pabineau
that falls into the Nepisiguit a short distance
below the Fall. It was once called
Pabina, and had the English name of Cranberry
Falls as well. Although the word is
of Indian origin, its present form is believed
to be Acadian French, meaning the Highbush
Cranberry. The Indians used to
spear a canoe-load of salmon at a time
by the Pabineau Fall in the days before
fishery wardens were appointed to patrol
the river.</p>

<p>There are splendid trout lakes on the upper waters of the
Nepisiguit, and the whole region is one of the choicest for sportsmen,
lovers of nature, and those who do not mind being away from the
towns. To see the river at its best, it is necessary to camp out with
guides accustomed to the management of canoes, and who are also
skilled in woodcraft. There are many such guides living all along
the lower part of the river. There are some excellent private fishing-club
houses, as well as a few where guests are received.</p>
<p>Theodore Roosevelt, who, in addition to his other qualifications,
is a genuine nature-lover, scout, woodsman and Nimrod, is always
at home in the upper waters of the Nepisiguit. Of this country he
wrote: &ldquo;Goodbye, lovely Nepisiguit, stream of the beautiful pools,
the fisherman&rsquo;s elysium; farewell to thy merry, noisy current, thy
long quiet stretches, thy high bluffs, thy wooded and thy rocky
shores. Long may thy music lull the innocent angler into day-dreams
of happiness. Long may thy romantic scenery charm the
eye and gladden the heart of the artist, and welcome the angler to a
happy sylvan home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The country just described is perhaps the best in all North
America for hunting and fishing. Some details and incidents relating
to this region will therefore be of interest.</p>
<p>The hibernating or marvellous winter sleep of bears is doubtless
well known to all. A large bear crawled out one April from
under a bridge of logs in the Upsalquitch district over which timber
had been hauled noisily all winter without arousing him from his
long, deep sleep.</p>
<p>Bruin plays queer antics. A bear broke into a lumber camp,
turned the tap of the molasses barrel, rolled over and over in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
sticky syrup, broke open a flour barrel with
one stroke of the paw and then rolled about
in the flour until he looked like a polar bear.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_108">
<img src="images/p0121.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="479" />
</div>
<p>An Indian without a gun was
once chased by an infuriated she-bear,
whose cub he had stolen. His
only refuge was a hollow tree, down
which he lowered himself with the
cub. The old bear descended bear
fashion, tail first. The Indian seized
her by the stumpy tail, whereupon he
was drawn to the top, and giving the bear a thrust off
on top of the stump, master of the situation.</p>
<p>A bear caught in a trap on the Patapedia by an Indian was
met by the hunter, marching around with the trap on one foot
and shouldering the pole to which it was attached, biting savagely
at the knots and boughs of trees he passed and inflicting terrible
wounds on the defenceless wood. Knowing there was a bounty of
three dollars a bear on the New Brunswick side of the boundary,
the Indian succeeded in driving him across the dividing brook.
This done, he shot him and got his bounty.</p>
<p>Another wily Indian cut off the snouts of two large Newfoundland
dogs, and producing them to the magistrate demanded
the bounty money. Being asked for the customary oath, he said,
&lsquo;Swear me in Indian, me no understand English well.&rsquo; &lsquo;All right,&rsquo;
said the unsuspecting justice. The guileless Indian then swore in
the Indian tongue that he had killed two large black dogs&mdash;and
pocketed the six dollars.</p>
<p>A story showing the humor of a Maliceet Indian, who was a
great snuff-taker, is the following: &ldquo;One time I go huntem moose,
night come dark, rain and snow come fast; no axe for makum wig-wam;
gun wet, no get um fire; me bery tired, me crawl into large
hollow tree; I find plenty room, almost begin sleep. By-and-by me
feelum hot wind blow on my face, me know hot bear&rsquo;s breath. He
crawl into log too; I takeum gun, she no go; I think me all same
gone, all eat up. Then me thinkum my old snuff-box. I take some
snuff and throw &rsquo;em in bear&rsquo;s face, and he run out, not very much
likeum. I guess me lay still all night, he no come again,
little while, bear he go O-me sneezum, over and over, great
times. Morning come, me fixeum gun and shoot &rsquo;em dead; he no
more sneezum, no more this time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>When an Indian catches a bear in a trap, he apologizes to
the animal, and asks that vengeance shall not be taken for his death.
He promises to respect his bones, and this promise he keeps; for
Indians burn bears&rsquo; bones instead of giving them, like other bones,
to the dogs.</p>
<p>Bruin is often very wily. A bear once dropped to the fire of
a hunter&rsquo;s rifle. Carefully reloading, the hunter advanced and
poked the animal to make sure it was not shamming. The bear
was motionless. The gun was laid down and a sheath knife drawn
to prepare Mr. Bruin for the camp bearers. Just as the hunter
grasped the forepaw the bear raised up, and a terrible struggle ensued.
A son of the hunter was commanded by the father to shoot, but the
boy was too nervous to risk a shot. Finally the hunter was worsted
and succumbed to his injuries just as the son gained command of
himself and lodged a bullet in Bruin&rsquo;s head. A singular part of the
story is the positive statement that only one bullet was found in the
bear&rsquo;s body&mdash;and that was the son&rsquo;s bullet that killed the animal at
the last.</p>
<p>Another story of a bear shamming has a happier ending, for
in this case the hunter reloaded and approached by stealth after
seeing Bruin drop like a stone to his rifle shot. This time the bear
&lsquo;came to life&rsquo; too soon. He was found standing, and ready to give
battle, until a second shot really hit him and ended all shamming.</p>
<p>Fish stories are always in order in a fishing country; and when
that country is the best the world has to offer, the stories may properly
be of fair proportions.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_109">
<img src="images/p0122.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="150" />
</div>
<p>On the Nepisiguit River a 45-pound salmon has been
known to leap from the water into a canoe. This
reverses the usual practice of suicides; and
perhaps it will be well to explain that as
a fish has to jump out of water to commit
felo-de-se, the salmon in question took
the easiest course.</p>
<p>Squirrels in swimming across a river are sometimes swallowed
by trout. As trout have often been caught weighing six pounds, this
story seems quite credible:</p>
<p>On a trouting excursion in this region so many fish were
caught that the fishermen became completely exhausted through
the incessant labor of hauling in the fish. On the homeward journey
they reached a place where large trout poked their heads out of the
water, but the fishermen had not enough energy left to throw a line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_110">
<img src="images/p0123.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="364" />
<p class="caption">In Camp</p>
</div>
<p>In good fishing waters, strange as it may seem, two trout
have been caught on the same hook with one cast of the line.</p>
<p>It may be well to remark that in Quebec and New Brunswick
the system of private leases of fishing privileges prevails. That is
to say, the fishing rights on a stream are either owned by those who
have bought land with river frontages, or they are leased outright
by the Government to fishing clubs of wealthy sportsmen who can
afford to have the river patrolled by fishery guards. A privilege
may include the right to cast a line in one pool, in a stretch of water
a mile or two in length, or over the course of the river for a distance
of fifty or even a hundred miles.</p>
<p>Club-houses are built at the principal spots where the best
fishing may be had, and there wealthy fishermen make their stay in
comfortable quarters during the salmon season. At Matapedia,
Campbellton, etc., may be seen whole truck loads of large boxes
some four feet long, each box having one or more fine salmon packed
in snow for transportation to friends of the anglers at New York and
other distant points.</p>
<p>The expense of maintaining the club-house, buying fishing
rights, employing fish guardians, etc., is borne by the members of the
club; and all things considered the sport of salmon-fishing is a royal
amusement costing a considerable amount of money.</p>
<p>The best rights are all bought up; but there are still some
places, as on the Upsalquitch River, where fair salmon-fishing may
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
be had at ten dollars a day and the cost of the fishing permit added.
In some streams, where fish do not abound, the cost is much less.
Sportsmen should bear these facts in mind before planning a fishing
trip. If really good sport with fine fish is desired, the best plan is
to communicate with the I. C. R. Agent at the nearest point to the
centre selected, and he will procure all the information required. If
planning a trip in June and July, do not wait until the fishing-rights
are let out and all the guides and boats are engaged&mdash;write in good
time, not later than the month of April or May, and have definite
arrangements made well in advance, including the important detail
of where to stay. Some of the best places for fish have neither
cabin nor camp anywhere near. In selecting a spot like this,
arrangements for tents and supplies, teams and guides, etc., should
be made at least some months ahead.</p>

<div class="img" id="pic_112">
<img src="images/p0126.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="394" />
</div>
<p>Jacques Cartier entered and named
La Baie des Chaleurs in the year 1535,
but before that time the unnamed waters
had been frequented by European fishermen,
drawn there by the splendid fishing
for which this bay has long been known.
The name &lsquo;Bay of Heats&rsquo; was probably
given to mark the genial temperature of
these waters as compared with that of the more frigid waters of
the Newfoundland shore. In very early maps it is termed La Baie
des Espagnols, or &lsquo;Spanish Bay&rsquo;, from the fact that many of the
early fishers were from Spain. The Indian name, Ecketuam Nemaache,
the English of which is &lsquo;Sea of Fish,&rsquo; is quite appropriate, too;
but the use of the name Bay of Chaleur is now universal.</p>
<p>The Bay is more than ninety miles long, and receives the
waters of fully sixty rivers and streams. Sea and brook trout are
found in nearly all of these tributaries, and in many of them the finest
salmon are caught. It is rarely stormy, on account of the protection
afforded by the projecting peninsulas, and the outlying islands,
Shippegan and Miscou. The air is clear and pleasant, and fog is
comparatively unknown. The tides, also, are quite moderate.</p>
<p>American fishing fleets visit these waters every year. They
may be seen in the spacious harbor of Miscou Island when they come
there from the outer waters for shelter in stormy weather. The Bay
of Chaleur has always been a favorite fishing-ground for New Englanders;
for it was a Yankee captain of whom Whittier wrote in his
&ldquo;Skipper Ireson&rsquo;s Ride,&rdquo; describing the punishment meted out to
that hard-hearted man for his cruelty in abandoning to its fate a
sinking craft manned by his fellow-townsmen.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Small pity for him!&mdash;He sailed away</p>
<p class="t0">From a leaking ship, in Chaleur Bay,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Sailed away from a sinking wreck,</p>
<p class="t0">With his own town&rsquo;s people on her deck!</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Lay by! lay by!&rsquo; they called to him.</p>
<p class="t0">Back he answered, &lsquo;Sink or swim!</p>
<p class="t0">Brag of your catch of fish again!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">And off he sailed through the fog and rain!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,</p>
<p class="t2">Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart</p>
<p class="t4">By the women of Marblehead!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The land on the north side of the bay is very bold, and considerably
varied. The Shickshock Mountains, running through
the centre of the peninsula, attain a height of nearly 4,000 feet. The
southern shore is much lower, with occasional elevations. The
outlying parts of Chaleur Bay and much of the coast may be seen
to advantage by taking a steamer from Montreal or Quebec down
the St. Lawrence and into the bay. The boats of the Gasp&eacute; Steamship
Co. run from Montreal to Gasp&eacute; and Port Daniel, calling at
Matane and many other parts of the south shore of Gasp&eacute; Peninsula.
The boats of the Quebec Steamship Co. also run from Montreal to
Gasp&eacute; and other parts of the Maritime Provinces.</p>
<p>A very good plan is to go from Campbellton to Gasp&eacute; by
the <i>Canada</i> of the Campbellton and Gasp&eacute; Steamship Co. The boat
puts in at many of the places along the north shore of Chaleur Bay,
and affords an excellent opportunity for viewing the coast scenery.
If preferred, the return journey may be made over the line of the
Quebec Oriental Railway from Gasp&eacute;, its present terminus, calling
at Douglastown, Barachois and Cape Cove, etc.; or it may be varied
by taking the steamship from Gasp&eacute; to Grand River, to see the
eastern Gaspesian coast by daylight, and making the remainder of
the western journey by train from Grand River. The railway
touches the towns and villages along the coast, connects with a
ferry for Campbellton, and terminates at Matapedia. On the return
trip a stop-off may be made at the principal places along the line.
This trip may be reversed and changed as may be found most
convenient.</p>
<p>Presuming it has been decided to go all the way to Gasp&eacute; by
steamship, and to return by way of Grand River and the railway to
Campbellton, a description of the country traversed now follows:</p>
<p>Leaving Campbellton at about 11 a.m. and putting in at
Dalhousie on the south shore, the steamship calls at Carleton, New
Richmond, Bonaventure, New Carlisle, Port Daniel, Grand River,
and Perc&eacute;, etc., arriving at Gasp&eacute; the next morning at 9 o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_113">
<img src="images/p0128.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="380" />
</div>
<p>The Bay of Gasp&eacute; is both long and
wide, being about twenty miles in length,
with a width of five miles or more in its
widest part. Rather more than half-way
in a small peninsula makes
out from the sandy beach to the
south, and another from the northern
shore. These afford admirable
protection for the upper water or
harbor, where there is room for a
great fleet to ride at anchor. The view from the water approach
to the town is delightful.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The mountains of Gasp&eacute; are fair to behold,</p>
<p class="t0">With their fleckings of shadow and gleamings of gold.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Several rivers empty into the bay and harbor, there are
noble hills around, and behind the town the high mountains rise.
A goodly fleet of whalers and fishing schooners leaves from this
port, and the smaller craft with the numerous boats, etc., add
greatly to the pleasant view that meets the eye on entering the
port. No better spot could be selected for enjoying yachting,
boating and fishing; while the cool air and splendid scenery leave
nothing lacking for the enjoyment of those who come here. There
are many visitors in the summer, and the life is a pleasant and social
one.</p>
<p>It was at Gasp&eacute; that Jacques Cartier landed, took possession
of the country in the name of his king, and erected a cross thirty
feet high adorned with the fleur-de-lis of France. Here, also, a great
naval engagement took place between the French and English, and
here, too, in later years a great English fleet arrived and captured the
village. The Gasp&eacute; Peninsula was formerly a province, with its seat
of government in this very town of Gasp&eacute;. It is now part of the
Province of Quebec. In this part also there survives a distinct tradition
of the Norse discovery of America.</p>
<p>The early Indians of this region are said to have been the most
intelligent of all the North American tribes or peoples. They were
far advanced in civilization, and had a fair knowledge of geography
and astronomy. In connection with the visits of the Spaniards Velasquez
and Gomez, and their meetings with the Gaspesian Indians, a
fanciful tradition survives in relation to the origin of the word &lsquo;Canada.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_114">
<img src="images/p0129.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="429" />
</div>
<p>The oft-repeated remark,
&ldquo;aca nada,&rdquo; or &lsquo;there is nothing
here,&rsquo; made by the Castilian
adventurers when disappointed in
their search for gold, was judged
to be of importance by the Indians,
who frequently repeated it to
Jacques Cartier. Cartier is supposed
to have mistaken this oft-heard
expression for the name of
the new country. A more likely
derivation, however, is found in the Indian compound word Caugh-na-daugh,
or &lsquo;village of huts;&rsquo; and this, it is thought, has gradually
settled into the euphonious and easily pronounced name of
&lsquo;Canada.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In later years the Micmac Indians were along the shores of
the Gasp&eacute; Peninsula in large numbers, but more recently they have
almost deserted the region, and are to be found in New Brunswick, etc.</p>
<p>It is related that when Lord Aylmer was Governor-General
he once went on an excursion to Gasp&eacute;. Micmac Indians to the number
of nearly 500 flocked to welcome the &lsquo;great chief.&rsquo; When the governor
landed with a brilliant staff, he was met by Peter Basket, the great
Micmac Chief, at the head of the aboriginal deputation. The chief,
a fine, powerful man, and surrounded by his principal warriors, at
once commenced a long oration in the usual solemn, singsong tone,
accompanied with frequent bowings of the head.</p>
<p>It happened that a vessel had been wrecked in the Gulf
some months previously, and the Indians proving themselves ready
and adroit wreckers had profited largely by the windfall. Among
other things they had seized for personal adornment was a box full
of labels for decanters, marked in conspicuous characters, &lsquo;Rum,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Gin,&rsquo; &lsquo;Brandy,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>The chief had his head liberally encircled with the usual ornaments,
and, in addition, had dexterously affixed to his ears and nose
some of the labels as bangles.</p>
<p>At first they were not particularly noticeable amid the general
novelty of the spectacle, but while listening to the prolonged harangue
of the chief, the governor began to scrutinize his appearance and
dress; and then his ears and nose with the labels inscribed &lsquo;Brandy.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Gin,&rsquo; &lsquo;Rum,&rsquo; etc. Glancing towards his staff he could no longer
maintain his gravity, and was joined in a hearty but indecorous
burst of unrestrainable laughter.</p>

<p>The indignant chief, with his followers, immediately withdrew,
and would neither be pacified nor persuaded to return, although
the cause of the ill-timed merriment was explained to him.</p>
<p>Sunrise on the Gasp&eacute; is a beautiful sight. The long stretch
of sandy beach, the opposite shore with the pine and fir trees in the
far background, the houses of the fishermen, the boats on the strand,
the waving fields of grain, the ever-brightening sun tinting all with
increasing light, and in the distant offing the dark hull of a vessel
that has not yet passed into the bay; all make a new picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a delightful haven of rest Gasp&eacute; is for the overworked
and sleepless New Yorker!&rdquo; remarked a Gothamite who makes this
his summer home. Another, on his return from mackerel fishing
exclaimed, &ldquo;What a glorious spot to recuperate exhausted nature!
No noise, no telegrams, no trusts, no bank troubles, no corporation
frauds, no boodlers, no presidential elections!...... Instead, sleep,
bracing air and incomparable landscapes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one is in a hurry here. They get up when they like. They
do not rush&mdash;they saunter. No feverish haste to do anything. If
a thing is not done to-day&mdash;very good, it may be done tomorrow.
Idle older people smoke all day, gossip a bit, take a walk, and otherwise
amuse themselves. They retire early and sleep soundly, undisturbed
by civilization&rsquo;s din.</p>
<p>A characteristic little story is related by Lemoine in his
excellent &lsquo;Maple Leaves,&rsquo; or Explorations in the Lower St. Lawrence.
It seems that the government of the day had sent a commissioner
to Gasp&eacute; to enquire into the discipline, etc., of the county prison
there. When he arrived, he found the jailer sitting on the court
house steps, in an easy chair, smoking a huge Dutch meerschaum.
This is a transcript of the dialogue that ensued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you step in, Mr. Commissioner, and see how we manage
here. My turnkey is away catching his winter&rsquo;s cod. My prisoners
are all in good health, and I have eighteen of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see them,&rdquo; replied the visiting official.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in a hurry&mdash;will it do after supper?&rdquo; asked the
genial jailer. &ldquo;I will have them all here then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot wait,&rdquo; replied the official, &ldquo;as I have to make up
my report at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry you have so little time,&rdquo; the jailer now remarked;
&ldquo;the fact is, my prisoners take a turn in the country every morning,
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
then they do up my garden, catch a
few fresh trout for dinner, and do other
little things; but at sundown all come
back here to sleep. I treat them well,
and they don&rsquo;t mind staying in at
nights. Wait until the evening, they
are looking up my two cows that are
off in the woods, and I promise to trot
out every man-jack of the eighteen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_116">
<img src="images/p0132.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="441" />
</div>
<p>There is excellent fishing in the
York and Dartmouth Rivers, as well
as in the waters of the harbor and bay; and visitors in pleasant Gasp&eacute;
have no lack of general summer amusements.</p>
<p>Steering south and crossing Mal Bay, the fishing village of
Perc&eacute; is reached, a district made remarkable by the neighboring
Perc&eacute; Rock and Bonaventure Island. After leaving Perc&eacute;, the
steamship passes between island and rock and affords fine views of
both.</p>
<p>Bonaventure Island acts as a breakwater for the Perc&eacute;
shores from which it is distant about two-and-a-half miles. Its
inhabitants are fishermen. The island is a mass of rock with cliffs
nearly 500 feet high, and a sail around it is very enjoyable.
Several desperate naval engagements have taken place nearby. It
is at the Perc&eacute; Rock, however, that interest centres itself strongly.</p>
<p>Perc&eacute; Rock is nearly 300 feet high and about 500 feet long.
Its precipitous sides rise directly from the sea. The huge cliff is
pierced by a lofty arch under which boats sometimes pass. Formerly
there was a second arch or tunnel near the outer end of the rock, but
it fell with a great crash, leaving only a high pillar of what had stood
before. The top is covered with grass; and sea birds in great numbers
make it their home. Their loud cries have often helped to guide home
the mariner when caught in a fog.</p>
<p>Of the general scenery found here much may be written
that is favorable. The village has two coves and is divided by the
Mont Joli headland. Artists and lovers of wild and romantic scenery
may find here all that their hearts desire. Mont Ste. Anne in
rear of the village rises almost abruptly to a height of 1300 feet or
more, and is the first sight of land obtained from vessels coming up
the Gulf to the south of the Island of Anticosti. On a clear day it
may be seen sixty miles away. The ascent towards French Town
commands a good general view, and makes an excellent standpoint
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
from which to see the Perc&eacute; Rock. A climb up Mont Ste. Anne
will disclose an outspread panorama the like of which is rarely seen.
As many as two hundred sail have been counted on the surrounding
waters. On the slopes, too, may be found fossil remains of elevated
beaches, and interesting specimens of fine quartz crystals, jasper
and agate.</p>

<p class="caption">In the Gasp&eacute; Country</p>
</div>
<p>The road through the mountain gorge or highway connecting
Perc&eacute; with Gasp&eacute; Basin has been likened to the best of Swiss scenery.</p>
<p>A number of quaint legends have their origin in connection
with the Perc&eacute; Rock. These all turn on the white and ghost-like
vapor often seen over the rock in the dim light, caused by flocks of
birds circling overhead in fantastic array before alighting. It is
told that a Breton maid lost her life here and that her spirit still
haunts the scene. Her lover in the days of long ago came to the
New Land to seek his fortune. She, his promised bride, he left
behind, until he could make a living and a home for her. He prospered,
and soon sent back word for her to come. She left, but met
a terrible fate on the way, for her ship was captured by Spanish
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
corsairs and she alone was spared to become the wife of the pirate
captain. She refused, and he swore she should never reach Quebec.
When he knew her story he threatened he would sail past Perc&eacute;;
and in sight of her lover she should be put to death.</p>
<p>This preyed on her mind to such an extent that at last, when
they drew near the place that was to have been the scene of her
happiness, she jumped overboard&mdash;the vigilance of her watchers
for a moment relaxed. She sank, and all attempts to rescue were
vain. As they were cruising about and searching the water, the
lookout discovered what appeared to be a woman rising from the
water with dripping garments. It was nearing sunset and the
vessel gradually drew near the rock, lured by the figure. It was
soon discovered that the ship was slowly sinking, and orders were
given to wear away from the haunted spot. In vain the crew tried
to obey. It was hopeless; for the ship was turning to stone, her masts
had become pillars of iron, her sails&mdash;slate.</p>
<p>Rapidly sinking she drew near to the Perc&eacute; Rock, and before the
pirates could jump over to swim ashore, they were turned to stone.
The doomed ship immediately struck the rock and became part of
it. Yonder point is said to have been the vessel&rsquo;s bowsprit, there
was the foremast, here the stern. Once clearly visible, they are now
worn down by wind and wave so that they appear to be an integral
part of the rock itself; but although the ship&rsquo;s identity is lost, the
wraith of the poor Breton maid lingers ever near the spot. Those
living near believe she will depart and be at rest when the last
vestige of the pirate ship shall have vanished.</p>
<p>It is said that sunset is the time to see the ghostly presence,
and so well is this believed that no fisherman dares to drop a line
near the spot when the evening sun dips low.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_118">

</div>
<p>Some ten miles south-west of Perc&eacute; is Cape Despair, near
which Queen Anne&rsquo;s great fleet
under Admiral Walker met grave
disaster in the great storm that
scattered and almost destroyed it.
Eight large vessels were wrecked,
and the bodies of several thousand
men were strewn along this shore
and on that of Egg Island. Fragments
of the wrecks were to be
seen along the coast until quite
recently. Here the &ldquo;Flying Dutchman&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
is still believed to prolong
his phantom existence, for the
natives say that sometimes when
the sea is quiet and calm, vast
white waves roll in from the Gulf
bearing on their crest a phantom
ship crowded with men in old-style
uniforms. An officer stands on the
bow, with a white-clad woman on
his left arm, and as the surge
sweeps the doomed ship on with
terrific speed, a tremendous crash is heard and
the clear, agonizing cry of a woman&mdash;and then, nothing is left to
view save the stern cliffs and the tranquil sea.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_119">
<img src="images/p0137.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="439" />
</div>
<p>The coast now makes off almost west, and soon the little
fishing village of Grand River, on the river of that name, is reached.
This was the former terminus of the coastal railway that now
extends to Gasp&eacute;. If desired, the return journey by rail to Campbellton
may start from here. Grand River has a good wharf and is a
place of call for steamers from Montreal, Campbellton, Dalhousie,
etc. The country is pleasant and rolling, while the scenery on the
river is both varied and picturesque. The fishing rights are leased,
as is the custom through the greater part of this province. The
open sea washes the shore, and the air is very enjoyable. The
river affords excellent canoeing.</p>
<p>Passing Pabos and the outlets of the Great and Little Pabos
Rivers, the spreading village of Port Daniel is seen, comfortably
placed on and near the river of that name and its tributaries,
as well as by the head of its own picturesque little bay. Near here,
at Pointe-au-Maquerau, the steamship <i>Colborne</i> went ashore with a
valuable cargo of silks, wine, hardware, silver-plate and specie. This
was strewn in great confusion along Harrington&rsquo;s Cove, and even at
Port Daniel. Much was picked up by wreckers from Gasp&eacute; and
Perc&eacute;; and the auction sale of the salvage brought wealth to many
along the shore, for the cargo was worth over $400,000. From the
top of the Cap au Diable mountain range a splendid panoramic
view may be seen. The rivers of this district are full of wild fowl in
the spring and fall. The Grand Pabos is quite a fine stream. Not
far away is Duck Cove, a pretty spot with a clear little stream
running down to the sea. West of Newport there is a rocky little
island close to the shore, well wooded in the center and admirably
suited for the erection of a small bungalow or summer home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_120">
<img src="images/p0138.jpg" alt="" width="701" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Perc&eacute; Village</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Further west is some of the wildest hill scenery, with rocky
gorges, and where foaming brooks may be seen cascading seawards
in a series of minute waterfalls. A bold and rising series of hills
marks the approach to the Gascon Capes, in the valleys of which
the streams make sheer plunges down to the shore line with many a
fall of picturesque beauty.</p>
<p>Just between Gascons and Port Daniel a branch of the Port
Daniel River winds a devious course to the ocean. On one side a
huge precipice rises, inaccessible and almost vertical. The river
washes its base, while on the other side rolling hills and a more-shelving
shore make it possible to walk near the river bed. Some
of the headlands and caves are very striking. The minute beaches
or sand-strips are covered at high tide, so that at such time it is
impossible to obtain a view save from above, or from the tip of some
further projecting rocky spur thrown out from the main cape.</p>
<p>Near Port Daniel may be observed a feature that is common
on the north Chaleur shore, for the inrush of the tide has carved out
lateral scoops in the sides of the inlets and bays, so that inwardly
projecting horns make a good anchorage for boats and vessels
where the sound of the breaking waves may plainly be heard coming
from the outer sides. Sometimes a short distance of ten or twenty
yards is all that separates the active sea from the quiet haven.</p>
<p>Some of the smaller streams have trees on opposite banks,
meeting close and mingling their shade overhead for mile after mile.
In many cases the only way to fish or view some pleasant water-course
is to walk in the water&mdash;for the banks generally rise abruptly.
It is only by the wider streams that gravel strips or edges of green
sward give a dry foothold. The pretty brooks and streams between
Grand River and Cascapedia have pure and sparkling water in their
channels, and these, like the streams to the east, are bordered by
perpendicular banks that are grass-grown and plentifully covered
with a profusion of wild flowers.</p>
<p>Paspebiac, the inhabitants of which are called &ldquo;Papsy-Jacks&rdquo;
by the English-speaking people hereabouts, with part of the village
towards the shore, tree-embowered, presents a pleasing aspect with
its group of vessels of good size lying in its clear waters. It
stands on a gentle slope that runs down to the sea. Near here
the railroad track runs very close to the brink of the cliff, so close
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
that it will not be long before the
inroads of the sea below will cause it
to be moved in.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_121">
<img src="images/p0140.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="400" />
</div>
<p>The Bonaventure is a river of
fair size on which lumbering is done,
as on all the important streams of
the peninsula. Clean lumbering, such
as the floating of logs, does not spoil
these excellent fishing rivers. It is
the sawdust and mill refuse that is
harmful, and there is a strict provision against this and other forms
of pollution throughout the whole of the Maritime Provinces.</p>
<p>In the neighborhood of New Richmond and the Grand and
Little Cascapedia Rivers the hills are mountainous and beautiful,
and a fine panorama of country is unfolded in proceeding west.
The village of Cascapedia is delightfully situated; and the river takes
a charming course through the finest of scenery, dividing into forks
and making many a turn in its course.</p>
<p>New Richmond is prettily situated in the midst of hills and
valleys in a country that is finely wooded. The district is well
watered, situated as it is between the two Cascapedia Rivers. The
head waters of the main stream reach well up towards the St. Lawrence,
and almost into connection with the Matane. There are
lakes of good size within convenient reach.</p>
<p>The country from here to Carleton, at the foot of the majestic
Tracadiegash Mountain, is full of interest and beauty. Gray sand,
dark firs seeking a foothold on the mountains, the meadows, the hay
fields, the bright yellow of the grain crops, the dark brown nearer
mountains and the blue-black distant range, overcapped by clinging
clouds, and the steamy vapor in long filaments lining the folds of the
hills that fade away into distance to right and left, are all fair to
behold. The pure white wings of the seabirds, even when far away,
are outlined with sharp cut distinction against the lofty mountain
background.</p>
<p>Here and there a tiny little hamlet hides modestly behind the
sheltering green, and the first glimpse of its presence is often the
top of the church spire barely showing through the leafy canopy.
Yonder a few dark roofs peep out from over the trees of lesser growth,
and down the shore are lighthouses and neat little wharves for vessels
and steamers. Owing to the long and narrow dimensions of the
farms, and their subdivision for various crops, the shore often presents
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
the appearance of a great checker-board, the dark and light
patches frequently alternating with exact regularity.</p>
<p>Carleton is a pleasant and cool little spot, spreading out
crescent-shaped on table land at the foot of the hills and right on
the shore, fronted by a clean sand beach. The village is peopled
by descendants of the Acadian French who came here from Tracadie.
It lies almost in a nook, nicely sheltered. The Bay of Carleton is a
fine sheet of water, with the points of Miguasha and Tracadiegetch
at its western and eastern boundaries. The little river Nouvelle
empties into its western end. It is a good place for sea fish, and
the brooks and streams inland are stocked with trout.</p>
<p>The Chaleur Bay shore of the Gasp&eacute; Peninsula has many
attractions for summer visitors, for being somewhat removed from
the regular highways of travel it still preserves its old-time appearance.
Those who spend a vacation in any of its homelike villages
or towns cannot fail to be pleased with all they will find there. The
great hunting and fishing opportunities are described under the
chapter &ldquo;Where to Go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In leaving the Gasp&eacute; shore, the province of Quebec is left
behind, and further progress east and south is in the province of
New Brunswick.</p>
<p>The once fire-swept, but again busy and prosperous, town of
Campbellton stands at the head of the navigable deep-water of
Chaleur Bay. The surrounding country is well diversified and exceedingly
picturesque with its valleys and conical hills. The Sugar
Loaf boldly overlooks all from an elevation of over 900 feet.
An excellent view of the broad Restigouche River may be had
from almost any part of the town. Campbellton has good wharves
and much shipping; it is also a busy Intercolonial Railway centre.
Because of its admirable situation it is a natural centre for hunting,
fishing and canoeing trips, and it
makes a good base for camping-out
parties. It is also finely adapted
for summer residence of those who
like to spend their vacation in a
town centre convenient to outlying
country and places of interest.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_122">
<img src="images/p0141.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="413" />
</div>
<p>Almost directly over the river
is Cross Point, sometimes called
Mission Point. Here there is a
reservation occupied by 500 Micmac
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
Indians. They are skilled in woodcraft and the management of
canoes, and make excellent guides.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_123">
<img src="images/p0142.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="410" />
<p class="caption">Dalhousie&mdash;Along the Harbor Shore</p>
</div>
<p>A few miles up the Restigouche above Campbellton a naval
encounter took place between the French and English, off Restigouche,
that resulted in the capture of the French and the destruction
of the shore defences at Battery Point. The whole place went
up in flames. Pieces of the old French vessels, and artillery, shells
and scraps of camp fittings have been found in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Dalhousie with its extensive water front, divided between
river and bay shore, its streets of generous length and proportion and
its pleasant walks and cool air, is a quiet place for summer enjoyments.
Here, as at Campbellton, there are splendid opportunities
for motor-boating open to those who take their own boats. There
is a very comfortable and homelike summer hotel on the ocean
front, about two miles from the Intercolonial Railway station.
Here boats are provided free of charge to guests. There is excellent
bathing, with good country and coastwise walks and rambles. A
pleasant life with restful surroundings may be enjoyed here. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
islands off the shore make pleasant objectives
for boating trips, and the natural arch of rock
in a little sandy cove, reached through the fields,
is a good direction in which to take a quiet stroll.
The beach is very enjoyable, and ladies spend
many happy hours here watching the children
boating and playing in the sand.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_124">
<img src="images/p0143.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="600" />
</div>
<p>Charlo River is one of that fine chain of
watering places or summer resorts that stretches
down the River and Gulf of St. Lawrence to
the Atlantic shore, following the line of the
Intercolonial Railway. From Charlo, and east,
the wide, open waters of the Gulf are gradually
reached; but strong as this district is in water
privileges and cool air, it has other features that are almost greater.
For Charlo is one of those delightful country places where fine woods
abound, where glorious country roads stretch out in many a shady
avenue of noble trees, and where a romantic river dashes and
plays over rocks, tumbles over falls, courses through gorges, ripples
under bridges, rests by the meadows and slumbers under the
shady hills. For fishermen it has great attraction, because it is
an &ldquo;open&rdquo; stream; but a still greater lure is the fact that fine
salmon are caught there, and the waters are not fished out. For
some reason, probably because of its pure water, salmon often turn
into the Charlo in large numbers. On that account and because of
the total absence of urban life, excellent fishing is the result.</p>
<p>The Charlo is a stream full of beauty, and one that the nature-lover
may enjoy to his heart&rsquo;s content. The country around and
every approach to the river is clean, picturesque and unspoiled by
vandal crowds. There are no excitements and no startling incidents
in the quiet life of the place. On the other hand, there is every suitable
surrounding and inducement to enjoy nature, to live a life of
quiet ease varied by healthful recreation amidst enjoyable surroundings&mdash;a
life that best fits the vacationist for active winter work in
the crowded city.</p>
<p>The conformation of the country through which the river
runs is such that fishing may readily be done in many places without
boats. Another advantage is that the river is close at hand. It
is not necessary to go a considerable distance before a line may be
well cast, for a short walk leads to woodland depths, leafy shade
and the secluded, rippling stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>

</div>
<p>A pleasant and comfortable
place is found at Henderson&rsquo;s, near
the bay shore, not far from the
mouth of the Charlo River, where
there is a combination of country
hotel, farmhouse and home. Here
visitors will feel at home from the
moment they arrive.</p>
<p>The house, built somewhat on the old French plan with an
open court behind and upper story verandas, has excellent porches
surrounding it, a pleasant outlook, and the bay shore a short
distance in its rear accessible for boating and bathing.</p>
<p>Bungalows are being erected, and a very enjoyable social
life is enjoyed by the happy fraternity that congregates here from
various parts of Canada and the U.S.A. A plan sometimes followed
is that of living in a simple but comfortable bungalow on the shore,
taking meals at the inn. Shacks and tents are also put up by the
proprietor for those who wish to enjoy outdoor life to its full extent.</p>
<p>Charlo, then, is one of those rare places where the sportsman
may take his wife and family, with the certainty of being comfortably
housed and cared for, and where all may amuse themselves with quiet
recreations of a healthful kind while he is away fishing the stream
for the noble salmon. It is also one of those summer places where
there are no throngs, and where the number found assembled in
the summer time is just right for social blending in one happy colony.
When the fishermen have returned, and all have admired the day&rsquo;s
catch, and when supper is over, how pleasant as twilight is setting
in to gather on the porches for intercourse, to recline in easy chair,
or to swing lazily in hammock for rest.</p>
<p>And as the young people wander off in &ldquo;twos&rdquo; and &ldquo;threes,&rdquo;
but mostly in &ldquo;twos,&rdquo; to see the glorious sunset from the porch of
a St. Lawrence bungalow or cottage; the fisherman, the nature-lover,
the charming bevy of young married ladies, their attentive husbands,
the sedate couples of riper age, and even the militant suffragette
who did not go off in one of the &ldquo;twos&rdquo;&mdash;all these gather to enjoy
the <i>dolce far niente</i> of a cool, summer evening in Charlo.</p>
<p>A larger stream than the Charlo, but one that has its fishing
rights leased, is the Jacquet River. Arrangements may easily be
made, however, by which a day or two or a week&rsquo;s fishing, or longer,
may be obtained at moderate cost. There is a growing feeling in
many pleasant places, such as Jacquet River, that individual fishing
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
rights retard the growth of a place, and it is likely that here and in
other districts leading men of the neighborhood will buy in the
fishing rights, not for their own use, but to charge a reasonable fee
by the day or week for those who would then come to fish.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_127">
<img src="images/p0146.jpg" alt="" width="606" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Charlo&mdash;A Path through the Woods</p>
</div>
<p>The whole neighborhood of the Jacquet River is a pleasant
one, with good woods and shady roads. There is a picturesque little
cove, with high and rocky banks, where boats may be kept, and the
sandy beach of which offers a desirable spot for children&rsquo;s play.
The upper reaches of the river are quite pretty, the drives are good,
and the country is well varied with hill and dale.</p>
<p>Passing east along the bay shore and dipping south by the
water-bend that forms Nepisiguit Bay, the town of Bathurst is
reached. This, one of the principal sporting centres of the province,
is in itself a pleasant summer resort, and, in addition, is a starting
point for a series of inner country places, as well as for tours and
journeys over the Nepisiguit River and to the interior lakes. The
town is situated on a tidal lagoon which is an inlet from the great
Chaleur Bay. The Nepisiguit and three smaller rivers empty their
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
waters here, and one of these, the
T&ecirc;te-a-gauche, or Fairy River, has a
small but very picturesque fall. The
Nepisiguit, as is well known, is one of
the finest salmon rivers of the province,
and the Nepisiguit Lakes teem with
trout. Moose, deer and game birds
are also here in abundance. Guides
and canoes may be obtained in the
district. Those interested in hunting
and fishing should consult Chapters
IV. and XV. where other information
of the kind is given.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_128">
<img src="images/p0147.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="564" />
</div>
<p>Pabineau, the Grand Falls of the Nepisiguit, and the upper
waters of the river may all be reached from Nepisiguit Junction,
from whence the short line of the Northern New Brunswick Railway
leads, and by which a way to these places and the inner lakes
is opened. In this direction many pleasant outings may be enjoyed.
To picnic by the rushing rapids, or on a bluff in full view of the
falls, is a unique experience and one that will be long remembered.
The short railroad referred to, which connects Bathurst with the iron
mines of the Nepisiguit, is a regular sporting highway&mdash;in summer
for the fishing, and in the fall for hunting.</p>
<p>The eastern arm of the Chaleur Bay is traversed by a railroad
that runs from Gloucester Junction and Bathurst to Caraquet,
Shippegan and Tracadie. There are several quiet places on this
shore that are quite quaint, and suited for those who wish to be off
the main route of travel. Caraquet is a pleasant little Acadian
settlement where sea fishing is carried on. Shippegan is on an
excellent harbor, and here deep-sea fishing and cool air may be enjoyed.
From Shippegan a crossing may be made by boat to the
island of the same name, a distance of about a mile. From Miscou
Harbor, at the northern end of Shippegan Island, a crossing may
be made in quiet water to the outermost island of Miscou, or a boat
may be taken instead from Caraquet. Both of these islands afford
the best of wild-bird shooting in the fall, such as geese, duck, plover,
etc. Miscou is an old French settlement, and from its harbor many
boats were formerly engaged in walrus hunting. Off Miscou a
curious fresh-water spring spouts up through the briny sea and
retains its freshness. Fishermen obtain drinking water here without
the necessity for going ashore.</p>

<p class="caption">Poling up Stream</p>
</div>
<p>The whole Chaleur shore from the region of Charlo River
down to Bathurst is a network of small rivers and streams where
trout may always be found; and because of their favorable position
the pleasant towns and villages that line this coast are sure to grow
and increase in favor as summer places.</p>

<img src="images/p0150.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="573" />
</div>
<p>Proceeding south on the Intercolonial
Railway, the important centre of Newcastle
on the Miramichi River is reached. Here
the fine river Miramichi empties into Miramichi
Bay, passing first through the island-protected
inner bay that makes such a
broad approach to Chatham and the wide
Miramichi at Newcastle. The prosperous
towns of Chatham and Newcastle are therefore
natural centres for outfitting and starting
on river journeys of such extent that the
whole of Central New Brunswick may easily be reached; and not
only that, but also Tobique River and the west, the St. John and
Madawaska to the far west, the Restigouche and Matapedia Rivers
to the north-west, the Upsalquitch and Nepisiguit Rivers to the
north, the Nashwaak and St. John Rivers to the south-west, and
Grand Lake, Canaan and Kennebecasis Rivers and the Bay of Fundy
to the south are all made accessible by the Miramichi River.</p>
<p>This grand system of waterways has no parallel elsewhere.
Canoeing, fishing, etc., over such an extensive chain of rivers is a
joy that, once tasted, calls back the happy nature lover again and
again to the fascination of continued exploration in a country that
is full of variety and beauty.</p>
<p>By this time the traveller has fairly entered New Brunswick,
and he cannot have failed to observe many differences between this
province and that he has recently left. Quebec is the old world,
with scarcely anything of the new in it, save its scenery, distinctive
of the Western Continent. New Brunswick, in its life, seems to
typify admirably the happy position occupied by all Canada, a
position midway between that of Old England and the great republic
to the south. With a strong sheet anchor of conservatism and respect
for old and tried institutions fastened firmly in Britain&rsquo;s shore, the
far-reaching and unbreakable cable, or indissoluble bond, of attachment
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
and love for the mother
country reaches out; but the sails
of the ship of state are not furled,
and the good ship <i>Canada</i> does
not ride inactive while the breezes
of modern progress and thought
pass idly over her bare spars; for
her sails are unfurled and turned
to the growing breeze, and when
that wind blows steadily from one
direction instead of in cats-paws,
eddies and squalls&mdash;the noble vessel will draw up on her anchor,
and her canvas will fill to the breeze as she sails steadily forward.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_132">
<img src="images/p0151.jpg" alt="" width="661" height="500" />
</div>
<p>And so the New Brunswicker, if you ask him how he is, will
not reply, like our British Cousin, &ldquo;Quite well, thank you; how are
you?&rdquo; Nor will he tell you he feels &ldquo;great&rdquo; or &ldquo;fine&rdquo;, like our American
cousin. Instead, he will tell you he is &ldquo;Not too bad!&rdquo; which,
as will be apparent, is about half way between the other expressions.
If you ask a New Brunswicker, &ldquo;Is it going to rain to-day?&rdquo; he will
reply, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think!&rdquo; Do not be deceived. This does not mean
that he does <i>not</i> think; it is his way of saying &ldquo;I think not.&rdquo; He
will be found genial, pleasant and manly, with a keen eye to the
main chance, but not making money his worship&mdash;as yet.</p>
<p>Miramichi Bay, or &ldquo;Bay of Boats,&rdquo; was visited by Jacques
Cartier. So many savages put out in their canoes that the bay was
literally covered by them&mdash;hence the name. Indeed, Cartier had to
fire off cannon to frighten them away lest they should swarm on and
overrun his little vessels. The next day the explorer made friends
with the Indians by giving a red hat to their chief.</p>
<p>The town of Chatham has a particularly fine situation near
the mouth of the river. Here large ocean steamships load their
cargoes of pulpwood blocks, timber and lumber, etc., for all parts
of the world. It is a splendid point for fitting out with fishing and
hunting equipment, and a convenient base for hunting, fishing and
camping-out parties. Enjoyable shorter trips may be taken down
the bay to Tabusintac, Neguac and Portage Island, as well as to
Fox island, Loggieville and Escuminac. Some of these places are
excellent for trout and wild-birds.</p>
<p>At Kent Junction, south of Chatham, on the line of the
Intercolonial Railway, train connections may be made for Kouchibouguac
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
Bay, the Kouchibouguacis River, and also for the pleasant
resort of Richibucto.</p>

<p>Newcastle is another centre, equipping-point and starting-place
for river trips, fishing, hunting, etc. It has a fine situation
on Miramichi Bay, and considerable shipping may be seen at the
wharves and mills on the water front. On this river, as on the rivers
of New Brunswick generally, the extent of the lumbering operations
may be judged from the timber rafts and immense quantities of
logs floating down stream on their way to the timber-booms and
saw-mills.</p>
<p>There is a pleasant trip up the Miramichi by steamer as far
as Red Bank, and down the bay to Chatham, and seaward there are
other interesting steamer routes. Newcastle makes a very pleasant
summer stopping-place, as it is quite convenient to many places of
interest in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>From Derby Junction on one side of the river and from
Chatham Junction on the other, two Intercolonial lines run by the
Miramichi to Blackville, where they join. From this point the line
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
runs to Fredericton along the river valley, and, from where the
Miramichi turns westward, the railroad keeps its southern course
and follows the Nashwaak river to its junction with the St. John.</p>
<p>The Indian word Miramichi means &ldquo;Happy Retreat,&rdquo; and
this describes its character not only for the old-time &ldquo;Children of
the Forest,&rdquo; but for the summer visitor as well. It is one of the
largest and most important rivers of the province. It has its source
in a lake not far from the distant Tobique River. It flows with
considerable rapidity in some places, and in the main over a bed of
shingle and gravel. The North-West and the Little South-West
branches are dotted with pleasant little hamlets in their lower
reaches. The Renous, Dungarvon, Batholomew and Cain&rsquo;s Rivers
all discharge into its lower waters, and well above Blackville the
pretty little Taxis River at Boiestown
marks the westerly turn of the
main or South-West Miramichi. At
Cross Creek the easterly running
Nashwaak turns abruptly south, and
over the heights and along this
picturesque valley the railway
reaches the St. John River, and
crosses over it to the southern bank
on which Fredericton is so beautifully
placed.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_134">
<img src="images/p0153.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="469" />
</div>
<p>In addition to the main river and its large tributaries, there
are numerous smaller streams and brooks that plash and fall or
glide smoothly along to swell the Miramichi; and there is hardly a
town or village along the route just traced that does not afford good
fishing and hunting, as well as all the joys the nature-lover knows
well he will find in such a superbly-watered and well-wooded country.
For touring to see the beauties of nature, for drives from the principal
centres, and for walking expeditions, no richer or prettier country
could be found. This is also the very heart of a great hunting
country. Indeed, it is a common thing to look from the passing
train and see the deer browsing and bounding gracefully within a
stone&rsquo;s throw of the track, or standing motionless by the edge of some
nearby thicket.</p>
<p>The Nashwaak itself has its own network of pretty little
tributaries, not least of which is the charming Tay; and here as in
so many parts of New Brunswick it is difficult to alight at random
in a place that has not water and canoeing facilities.</p>

<p class="caption">Canoeing on the St. John River</p>
</div>
<p>The following description of a canoe trip on the Nashwaak is
typical of hundreds of similar journeys that can be taken along the
course recently traced, and indeed on any of the rivers and waterways,
great and small, with which the province is so liberally endowed.
As it is most convenient to make this particular excursion
from Fredericton, that place is taken as the starting point from
which the canoe puts out.</p>
<p>It is a bright morning, the air is playing in a gentle breeze,
and the St. John River gleams with many a dancing ripple as we
take our way well up stream to drop down quietly with the current
as we drink in the glorious view on every hand. Higher up, where
the banks become bolder, the lumbermen&rsquo;s piers of stone, cribbed
in with timber, and overgrown with young tree shoots and wild-flowers
in profusion, line the centre of the stream like so many
ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Yon shimmering surface in the distant valley, at the foot of
a bold hill, is not a placid lake bathed in the beams of the early sun&mdash;it
is a white and fleecy morning mist catching the side rays horizontally
and reflecting them in long pencils of light.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>At times the hills and woodland over there terminate abruptly
in long stretches of perfectly smooth meadow-land, stretching out
like a well-laid carpet, and with only an occasional high tree by the
edge to mark the course of the river.</p>
<p>We are nearly opposite the Nashwaak, and paddling across
the northern half of the broad St. John we reach the rich meadows
that lie at the mouth of the stream upon which we shall
soon float.</p>
<p>Gliding up stream with easy paddling, the covered bridge is
reached and we thread our way through the loose floating boards
and made-up rafts of deal that mark the lumberman&rsquo;s highway.
A little further up, however, a stop is made, for here is a boom of
heavy timbers, chained directly across the stream. We soon find
a place where there is a clear waterway near the shore, some three
or four feet wide, and pushing through this we speed on.</p>
<p>But the rippling murmur of water falls on our ears, and
looking ahead we see the wavelets, eddies and bubbles that mark a
swiftly flowing current. Bending to with a will, and at times using
the paddle as a pole in very stiff water, we manage to work our way
up higher.</p>
<p>And now another obstruction is met, a boom that completely
closes the way, with no water passageway of any kind. And so,
keeping inshore and balancing on one of the logs, while using
one hand for support against the almost perpendicular bank, we
pull the canoe over the boom, step in, and once more proceed
on our way.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_137">
<img src="images/p0156.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="499" />
</div>
<p>The lively kingfisher makes flights up the
stream in advance of our progress, sweeping down
at times with unerring eye to seize his prey from
under the surface of the water, and then resting
on some projecting tree branch he gives opportunity
for admiring his comely appearance before
our near presence warns him to renewed flight.
Well up above the water, but skimming the trees
and brushing the leaves as he flies, he keeps us
company, and soon is joined by other merry
fellows that make the way lively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_138">
<img src="images/p0157a.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="137" />
</div>
<p>Here is a huge eagle
with a wing-spread of five or
six feet, at least. Seemingly unafraid,
he drops almost alongside on
the bank that runs down to a flat
sand strip; and as he stands still
as we pass, we can see the pure white of his head and tail, and
notice his powerful wings as he again soars in the air.</p>
<p>Wild canaries, also, are quite numerous; and the canoe voyager
on the Nashwaak has no lack of pleasant company.</p>
<p>Several pieces of swift water have been passed, and at one
point where the river meets an island and has a steep descent and
sharp bend of the channel, the rushing fall of water carries us nearly
into the shore; and it takes both paddles to make any progress by
&ldquo;poling&rdquo; or pushing on the bottom of the river.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_139">

<p class="caption">Under the Dam&mdash;Nashwaak River</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Going further, we look with apprehension on an apparently
insurmountable barrier in the form of an immense log, wedged
solidly across stream between the high banks, with a very narrow
channel and, of course, plenty of rushing water. The log does not
touch the water, being held in position about a foot, or less, above
it. Holding to the huge barrier we force the head of the canoe
beneath it, and pressing down with united weight we manage to get
past by scrambling over the log and dropping into the canoe as it
passes clear.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_140">
<img src="images/p0158.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="607" />
<p class="caption">On the Nashwaak River</p>
</div>
<p>A very pretty stretch of water now marks the gradual approach
to the Marysville dam, and here occasional streaks of rapid
water are found as the channel contracts. At last we reach the
foaming run, or rapid, just below the fall, and a lively time ensues
before the canoe is brought right under the curtain of the waterfall.
Turning now to descend, the full current of the rapid is behind.
Watching until we head right, and planning to reach a quiet pool
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
below, to rest awhile, our skilful guide propels us boldly into the
midst of the foaming current.</p>
<p>Hurrah! This is fine! We are where the current is swiftest,
and where waves curl and boil over with dashing foam. There! a
sheet of white spray! and we have tasted the Nashwaak. We take
the water like a duck, are whisked past the point at a tremendous
speed, and then, with a powerful stroke of the paddle, we make a
quick and giddy turn&mdash;to find ourselves in still water, taking a few
moments of well-earned rest.</p>
<p>While the Nashwaak, in the main, may be termed a meadow
stream, it has many places in its upper waters where high and rugged
banks, wild woodland and steep fall make scenes of romantic beauty.
It is not open in the sense that a canoe may go all over its course
without meeting obstruction, as may be done on so many other rivers
in the province. It is one of those small streams that many prefer
just for the fun of making easy portages and crossing such barriers
as those described, as well as over occasional bars of sand or gravel
in shoal places.</p>
<p>A journey of 20 to 25 miles may be taken up stream in this
way. One in each canoe is best for the upper waters. There are
pleasant little settlements all along the shore, and simple refreshment
may be obtained, as well as sleeping accommodation, if the
canoeist desires to prolong the trip and take time to see the inner
country at his ease.</p>

<p>No matter how Fredericton may be
approached, from north, east, south
or west, by land or water, train, carriage,
in steamboat or canoe, the impression
sure to be received, as the
capital is neared, is that of forest
depths, great rivers and immense natural
resources. A feeling of admiration
and awe, akin to that felt by our
humble Indian brother as he roamed
the depths of these noble forests, casts a spell over the thinking
mind. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; says Bryant in his &lsquo;Forest Hymn&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>As is meet and proper, we do not plunge into the hurly-burly
of modern life in Fredericton, the capital city of the province.
Instead, we reach a peaceful, tree-embowered and altogether delightful
forest city. Here is refinement of life and civilization enough
to meet all reasonable demands, yet back of all there still reigns
the too-quickly-vanishing spirit of rest, the absence of haste, the
old-time simplicity. How delightful if all towns and cities were
no larger than charming Fredericton, with its modest 8000 inhabitants.
No trusts! No cold storage! No horrid skyscrapers! No
cars! It sounds too good to be true. And yet at Fredericton no
cars are needed; and, as a result,
all who visit the homelike capital
will know more of it than they
possibly do of their own city. Here
it is a delight to walk and ramble;
and, of course, driving is a great
joy with such woodland surroundings
and fine river scenery. An
inhabitant of Fredericton once
actually expressed a desire to live
in New York! Incredible! Impossible!
you cry. And so say all of well-balanced mind. But
mortals do not always know when they are well off; and a fit of
temporary insanity sometimes gains a flitting lodgment in the
brightest mind.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_144">
<img src="images/p0163.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Few cities are better or as well situated as Fredericton. It
stands on the noble St. John, which here is nearly three quarters of
a mile wide. The five older streets and the two newer ones all run
parallel with the river. There are shady trees on pleasant streets
wherever you go. In the heart of the city you are still in the
country. Nature everywhere is so profuse and abundant that it
almost shuts out the view of Cathedral Church and Parliament
Buildings, and enwraps fountain, statue and river-bank-seat with its
wealth of foliage; while in many a shady street the tree branches
knock at the house windows for admittance, and place smiling clusters
of bloom in the hands of those who throw open the casement in
response to the call.</p>
<p>Queen Street is the principal thoroughfare. At its west end
is the substantial building known as Government House, the official
residence of the Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick. Between
Queen Street and the river, in a central
situation, are the large barracks that were
formerly the headquarters of the British army
in this province. At the lower end of the street
is the handsome Parliament Building, where a
small but choice library may be consulted, and
from the dome of which building an extensive
view may be enjoyed.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_145">
<img src="images/p0163a.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="702" />
</div>
<p>Christ Church Cathedral, the recent fire
damage to which has been repaired, is patterned
after that delightful type of old English church
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
seen in many a quaint parish of the distant motherland. It has
a graceful spire and pretty interior, with a beautiful stained glass
chancel window presented by the Episcopal Church in the United
States.</p>
<p>The substantial building so firmly seated on the southern
hills is the University of New Brunswick, the higher education
centre of the province. Here there is a geological museum; and
from the cupola of the building a wide view may be had of the river
and surrounding country.</p>
<p>The glory of Fredericton is the St. John River with its fine
scenery and numerous excursions up and down stream; nor must there
be forgotten the added pleasure of sailing over the tributary streams
such as the Nashwaak, the Nashwaaksis, the Keswick, the Oromocto,
the Jemseg, etc.; and of reaching Grand and Washademoak Lakes,
and the numerous smaller lakes that are all about.</p>
<p>There are excursions up the river to Woodstock and the
numerous riverside places on the way. It is even possible to go all
the way to Grand Falls by water. Then the St. John River steamboats
go down the river daily to St. John and the towns and villages along
the banks of the river.</p>
<p>Nearly opposite Fredericton at the mouth of the Nashwaak
formerly stood an old French fort erected by Villebon. Acadian
refugees flocked to Ste. Anne at the time of the &ldquo;Expulsion,&rdquo; and
sought refuge under the protection of the fort; but after the American
Revolutionary War the exiled American Loyalists drove away the
Acadians to Madawaska, and settled themselves along the shore
in their place.</p>
<p>A world of pleasant exploration lies above the Grand Falls
in the upper waters of the St. John and its tributaries, but this region
while quite accessible from Fredericton, is somewhat remote for the
average summer visitor, and the Middle St. John from Grand Falls
to Fredericton is the district herein described.</p>
<p>Like many of the great rivers that have numerous tributaries
and increase in their descent almost to the proportions of inland
seas, the middle waters of the St. John, deep in places, have shallow
reaches and rapids where the current is very swift. Some distance
above Fredericton it becomes turbulent and foaming in many a seething
descent; but it is possible to take an outing over a considerable
distance, without portages, in a canoe with two men using poles.</p>
<p>A swift motor-canoe of light draft may easily make a two-days&rsquo;
journey up, giving four days on the St. John, with stops for
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
meals, etc., at convenient places. The river is sufficiently well settled
to lay out in advance a plan for stopping-places for meals, as well
as for resting or putting-up at night. This is much more convenient
and not nearly so expensive as taking guides and tent equipment,
food and cooking utensils, etc.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_146">
<img src="images/p0165.jpg" alt="" width="605" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Boiling the Kettle</p>
</div>
<p>For those who desire to spend several weeks on the river it
is necessary to have guides, canoes and tent equipment, especially
if remote places are to be visited. There can be no doubt that camping
out on the St. John is one of the most delightful ways of spending a
healthful vacation. A plan by which the expense of guides may be
avoided is that of camping out in a choice place not far from a settlement,
or a farm, and where there is plenty of recreation in walks,
sailing the river, fishing for trout, etc., without the necessity for exploring
the untrodden woods. Where any kind of exploration is to be
done, or unfrequented places visited, it will be understood that guides
are necessary; and it is illegal to go without them for hunting, etc.</p>
<p>In camping on the river to enjoy boating, bathing, fishing and
outdoor life, the plan is recommended of employing someone in
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
Fredericton to take out the party and equipment, and leave them
in a locality where supplies, such as milk, bread, etc., are easily
obtained. At the expiration of the fine holiday that will thus be
enjoyed, those employed to bring out the party will come and take
them back to Fredericton. There are many springs of cool and
sparkling water all along the whole route, and farms on both sides of
the river where produce, poultry, butter and eggs, as well as bread,
may be bought by previous arrangement. To have the full pleasure
of the river in such an outing, a canoe or row boat of very light draft
should be left with the camping party, and poles as well as paddles
or oars should be provided.</p>
<p>In addition to choosing a convenient place for water, shade
and supplies, etc., care should be taken to place the camp at some
point on the shore where there is a good stretch of easy water for
several miles above and below. This will afford pleasant cruising,
without the constant labor of poling through swift water.</p>
<p>Such a place is the &ldquo;Reach,&rdquo; above Long Island, and below
Tapley Bar and the Koack Islands. In the neighborhood of Hawkshaw
and Pokiok will also be found good camping-grounds meeting
all needful requirements, and within easy reach of the Shogomoc
River and Lakes. There are other good places nearer Fredericton
if desired. Of course, if there are athletic young men in the party&mdash;not
forgetting young women who love outdoor life and are able
to handle pole and paddle&mdash;the locality of a difficult piece of swift
water, or even that of a sheer rapid, may purposely be chosen to
have plenty of fun close at hand.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_147">
<img src="images/p0166.jpg" alt="" width="543" height="500" />
</div>
<p>For those who have never yet cut loose from the ties of
hotel or other stopping-place, a vacation of this kind is strongly
recommended; for the freedom and joy of living so close to nature,
and, it may truthfully be added,
nature at her best, is an experience
that brings back youth to the
middle-aged, and exuberance of
spirits to young and old alike.</p>
<p>Oh! the fascination of the
musical rapid, and ah! the glory of
the starlit evening with its gentle
breeze and its hours of calm repose
followed by sweet and health-giving
sleep&mdash;the tent well open to
the fragrance of the balmy air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>As an example of a pleasant excursion from Fredericton, an
account of a two-days&rsquo; journey of some 45 miles up the St. John in
a motor-canoe is now given, and this could be extended to a trip of
some weeks, or even months, by exploring the upper tributaries to
their headwaters. Many of the places nearer Fredericton may be
reached, and the starting point regained, in a day, or even in half
a day, and the route may constantly be varied by taking the different
tributaries in turn.</p>
<p>A start was made from Fredericton in the early morning; and,
in addition to handbag and raincoat, a bag of fruit was taken to
give variety to our meals at the farmhouses along the river.</p>
<p>Our eighteen-foot canoe with a 2&frac12; h.p. motor, piloted by the
able and obliging Davidson, of Fredericton, started gaily up-stream
and passed under the graceful iron town-bridge&mdash;the sun behind
thick banks of cloud, and apparently threatening rain. As the
clouds screened us from the hot rays of an August sun, we took little
thought of the dark sky: for we knew by experience that such a
beginning often ended in a bright and clear noonday.</p>
<p>After splendid running for a few miles, we tied up at Springhill
and climbed the path up the bank to the lumber-camp and boarding-house
above. Here were roadside inns in the olden days, with their
quaint names, such as &ldquo;Dewdrop inn,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Rest and be Thankful.&rdquo;
Here the jolly and amphibious red-shirted raftsmen used to congregate,
and here, too, their good-hearted successors make their down-river
headquarters.</p>
<p>It took a few minutes to prepare our breakfast of coffee,
toast, fresh eggs from the fine poultry run, and new milk from the
cows browsing in the pretty tree-bordered meadows hard by.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_148">
<img src="images/p0167.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="498" />
</div>
<p>Breakfasting and taking a refreshing
draught of cool spring water,
we regained our canoe, and as the
upward course was resumed the sun
burst through its cloudy barrier and
shone down with cheering effect. Passing
Percy Bar and the Keswick Islands
we have an opportunity of testing the
important question of speed, for in
the narrower channels the current has
a velocity of four to six miles an hour,
and sometimes even faster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Before entering a rapid or piece of swift water, we carefully
oil the working parts of the motor, and see that everything is in
trim for our struggle against the stream. Off we go for our first
tussle, and in a minute more we are in swift water, with circling
eddies and a foam-lined shore.</p>
<p>The water is higher than usual, owing to recent rain and
well-swollen tributaries. The whole current of the great river flows
through the one channel we have just entered. Fortunately, the river
is deep here, and it gives a good hold for our rapidly revolving screw.
The engine working well, the lever is pushed to &ldquo;full-speed,&rdquo; and in
a moment we are cleaving the water into two high ridges at our
bow, while the throbbing motor settles down to its best speed.</p>
<p>We look ashore a little anxiously, it must be admitted, for we
appear unequal to our task, the trees alongside and the rocks by the
shore holding fixed positions on our beam. It is only for a moment,
however, for soon we creep along shore, slowly, very slowly; and
yet we are gaining. After half-an-hour&rsquo;s steady going we emerge
into a wider channel, the current loses its force and now we go ahead
with increasing speed.</p>
<p>Here we are in a run that is clear save for the quantities of
logs floating downstream, and which are being gathered in and
made up into rafts to be towed or guided with poles to the maws of
the rapacious mill. The long boom of logs fastened together end-wise,
the walking platform and the small floating shanty, together
with the constant downward stream of logs of all sizes going down
singly, in &ldquo;twos&rdquo; and &ldquo;threes,&rdquo; and, at times, in great bunches, all
make an interesting incident in the trip; and to thread a devious way
in and out of the swiftly passing timber keeps our rudder in constant
oscillation as we follow the ever-changing path.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_149">
<img src="images/p0168.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="339" />
</div>
<p>Here is Lunt&rsquo;s Ferry. We see the high, steel cable strung
across the river, with the running block and gang ropes connecting
it with the side-railed flat barge or ferry. These floats are often
propelled across stream by the
force of the current. Just as a ship
makes headway by the side wind
running off her sails obliquely, so
does a boat cross a stream by the
action of the tide, if care is taken
to have the boat&rsquo;s head turned
partly against the current. The
boat being fastened to a transverse
cable and running block to prevent it from being driven down
stream, the tide strikes the hull obliquely and causes progression
in that direction towards which the boat is headed. When the tide
is sluggish a gasolene boat is frequently used to ensure more rapid
progress. Moored alongside, it soon pushes the ferry across; and
when traffic is active this is the best motive power.</p>

<p>Soon we run under high bluffs and notice the fine growth of
woods covering the almost perpendicular heights, and which touch
the side of the steep slope with their projecting side branches. The
varying shades of green in the woodland, the giddy height, the far-extending
reflection in the now sunlit river, all combine in a beautiful
picture; and again are we tempted to land and drink of a sparkling
stream that can be seen flowing down the mountain side in a
minute but clearly-defined rivulet.</p>
<p>Giving the engine a few minutes&rsquo; rest, we again push on, and,
after passing French Village, the pretty little Macinquac stream
joins ours on the right, and directly under the picturesque bluff,
with its quaint white church showing like a beacon through the
trees, a landing is made and we push our canoe tip into the mouth
of the little stream, drinking in the while all the beauties that are
on every hand.</p>
<p>Once more afloat, for we are thinking of a place for dinner,
and we wish to find refreshment without waiting. In this way we
may push forward and cover the considerable distance of swift
water that intervenes before we reach our destination where we are
to sup and lodge.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a suitable place is fairly close at hand, and,
dinner over, we resume our course upstream. The engine now
&ldquo;kicks-up&rdquo; a little, as all self-respecting motors must do, sooner or
later. Again oiling the parts, we push from off-shore again, for we
had pulled in to avoid being drawn down by the current, and thus
losing ground.</p>
<p>But we do lose ground, for when we push off into deep water
to give the screw a chance to revolve without chipping the rocks,
the canoe is turned right around, and downstream we go, the engine
obstinately refusing a single turn.</p>
<p>Back to the shore we go with paddle, and after a few operations
with the motorist&rsquo;s beloved tool, the wrench, and sundry
squirts here and there from his much cherished oil-can, the engine
starts to revolve with savage energy. It came so unexpectedly
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
that we are off full speed downstream before we
recover. Putting the helm over
we head up the river and are just
settling down to regain the lost
way, when&mdash;the engine stops!</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_151">
<img src="images/p0171.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="419" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Variety is the spice of
life,&rdquo; so we take to the shore
again and hold fast to a log conveniently
stranded for our use.
These little incidents, it may be remarked, give
added pleasure to the excursion, and for the true
motorist they supply that fulness and joy in life that cannot be
obtained in any other way. This time the real seat of the trouble
is found&mdash;moisture bridging the spark-gap.</p>
<p>Hurrah! Now we are off, in real earnest, and triumphant
smiles come quickly as swift water is passed and we finally get over
Big Bear Island Bar with only a few glancing knocks of the propeller
on a stray rock or two.</p>
<p>Twilight has come and gone. The trees are still, and not
a breath ripples the long and straight course of the river wide and
ghostly, and reaching into darkness at the end of a lengthy vista
that is only dimly defined&mdash;partly by the tall trees on each side, but
more by the patch of faint light that falls on the water down the
avenue before us. Gray forms float on the surface of the stream,
turning a ghostly white as they near us. We look over to examine
more closely, and find small floating islets of froth or foam, made
hours before far up, and now borne on the glassy surface of the
tranquil stream, gathering in size as they descend, or breaking
against obstructions and vanishing suddenly out of sight.</p>
<p>Soon the surface of the river shows a pale gleam of light,
and the white trunks of the silver birches begin to lose their spectral
appearance as they stand out, one by one, from the dense pall of
overhanging foliage. We look behind and enjoy to the full that
glorious spectacle, moonrise on a wide and beautiful river, in a
country rich in mountain and vale; and as the increasing light brings
into view one feature after another of the unfolding landscape, we
marvel at its beauty, and at the softness and delicacy of all when
pencilled by that companion and friend of the traveller by night&mdash;the
gentle moon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>As we look behind at the dancing wavelets left in our wake,
the crest of each gleams white and brilliant ere it subsides in milky
foam; while down the widening and rippling channel just made by
the revolving screw a thousand gleams of light are refracted into a
glorious play of ever-changing color.</p>
<p>The sound of the motor is jarring when viewing a scene so
fair. So turning the canoe and stopping the engine, we drift
inshore to view the surroundings in perfect quiet.</p>
<p>How bright the planets show when seen from a deep valley
on such a night, and how marvellous and grand the sight when from
almost total darkness and confused or indistinguishable detail the
whole beauty of the view steals out, line by line, giving time to admire
each new feature as it springs into sight, until finally the whole glorious
landscape and wondrous river are spread before in a soft blending
of light and shade impossible to adequately picture or describe.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, though supperless, we turn our canoe and continue
our way upstream. We are now on a river of molten silver,
floating down a path at once fantastic and beautiful. The reflected
and inverted banks of the river are close to us on each hand, the
tree branches sharply outlined and gently quivering under the influence
of a balmy zephyr that now steals with velvet touch over
the surface of the water.</p>
<p>Are we really in cloudland? we ask, so spiritual is the scene&mdash;and
as if to dispel all uncertainty a distant gleam of light reveals
the far-away course of the river, as it seems to pass on to the sky,
where it flows through the splendid portals of a gorgeous palace
built in the clouds and limned with outlines of pale silver by the
artist moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All journeys have an end.&rdquo; Journeys are also said to &ldquo;end
in lover&rsquo;s greetings.&rdquo; Sometimes, however, they terminate with
a fine supper cooked by the obliging wife of a good-hearted farmer
for two supperless men dropped from the clouds, as it were, one
hour before midnight. And here we are at Davidson&rsquo;s Ferry, a
good supper with a night&rsquo;s repose on a comfortable bed surely making
a happy ending for one part of our trip.</p>
<p>After a 6 o&rsquo;clock breakfast next morning the canoe is headed
up the lovely St. John&mdash;for are we not bound to reach the Nacawick
stream, Pokiok, the narrow gulf, and its waterfall, Clare Mountain,
the Meductic Fall and the Shogomoc Rapids. And we do reach
these in good time, and after admiring the rocky banks of the river
near Hawkshaw, the beautiful views at Pokiok, the narrow chasm
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
and the little waterfall at the
Gulf, and the bold Clare Mountain,
we finally reach our goal&mdash;the
Shogomoc Rapids. Here we
turn inshore in full view and
sound of the famed swift water.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_152">
<img src="images/p0173.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="499" />
</div>
<p>What an exhilarating spectacle,
and how the waters dash,
foam and roar as they are hurled
headlong down the steep descent.
What a splendid place to camp
anywhere near here&mdash;one would
surely never tire of such delightful
surroundings. As we sit and watch the water assume ever-changing
forms, we think of the Indians and their life on these waters in the
long ago, and in fancy we see them mounting the crests of the billows
and passing up and down the river in perfect safety.</p>
<p>Up and down is doubtless wrong, for who could propel a
boat upstream against a foaming current going over ten miles an hour,
and often nearer fifteen! Discussing this with our guide, he declares
he feels like going up in the motor-canoe as far as he can, and,
he adds, &ldquo;By George, I believe I can get through!&rdquo; We laugh
him to scorn. He persists in trying it. At last we decide to join
in the experience.</p>
<p>We oil up and make all ready. Off we go! right into the
midst of the foam at the lower end of the rapids. The engine works
furiously at full speed while we watch results.</p>
<p>We are making rapid progress in the wrong direction; for
working full speed ahead, we gain just enough way to get into
the direct current and then
downstream we go, stern first,
Davidson joining in the laugh
at his expense. &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo;
we say, &ldquo;we were right in the
midst of it, and the boat did
splendidly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Is there need to describe
the pleasures of the
return journey? How our
host of the previous night,
Davidson&rsquo;s brother&mdash;who had
come with us from his ferry to the rapids&mdash;insisted on our stopping
off at his house for dinner; how we did so and found by experience
that city &ldquo;cream&rdquo; has a very rich but distant relative known as
&ldquo;country cream&rdquo; which turns tea into nectar. Nor is there need for
a description of how we operated the ferry, said &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo; and went
downstream&mdash;wind, current and gasolene all in our favor&mdash;at a
clip of twelve miles an hour and sometimes faster; nor how we sped
by the men poling their rafts downstream, giving them time only
to greet us with a friendly call and wave of the hand before we were
well by; or how we gasolened triumphantly into Fredericton by
eight at night, just in time for a nice supper at the hostelry near to
the steamboat landing, and to take a little turn on the Promenade
before retiring for sleep that came so fast as to almost close our
eyes before head could be well cushioned in downy pillow........
all the details attending these various incidents must be left to the
imagination: and also those of the moose we saw in the woods, the
wild birds on the wing, the flocks of wild ducks in the water&mdash;twenty
and more at a time&mdash;that allowed us
to pass close by without taking fright,
the young deer that watched us cunningly
from woodland and thicket, the
partridges, the soaring eagles, the leaping
salmon, and the fishermen hauling
in their well-stocked nets.</p>

<p>On the way to Pokiok two small
streams are passed, the Indian names
of which have been humorously embodied
in the last two lines of this
extract from De Mille:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sweet maiden of Passamaquoddy,</p>
<p class="t">Shall we seek for communion of souls</p>
<p class="t0">Where the deep Mississippi meanders</p>
<p class="t">Or the distant Saskatchewan rolls?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ah no! in New Brunswick we&rsquo;ll find it&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">A sweetly sequestered nook&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Where the sweet gliding Skoodawabskooksis</p>
<p class="t">Unites with the Skoodawabskook.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Few who reach Fredericton and the Middle St. John River
will care to turn back without seeing the Grand Falls. It is one of
the three greatest cataracts of the upper continent. It has almost
a perpendicular drop, and the volume of water falling and thundering
on &ldquo;Split Rock&rdquo; below is a sight to be long remembered. A great
column of spray surmounts the lower rocks, and throws to the bright
sunlight a play of rainbow-color with beautiful effect against the
sombre foam-washed rocks. It is a splendid sight to see great logs
passing over the brink. Even in the channel above great timbers
of forty feet in length are tossed out of the water bodily, and when
they are hurled headlong over the fall and into the depths below&mdash;often
piled there momentarily, in almost inextricable confusion&mdash;the
spectacle has a fascination in it that compels intent observation.
There is a winding gorge below, and there are places such as &ldquo;Pulpit
Rock,&rdquo; the hollowed-out &ldquo;Great Well&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Coffee Mill&rdquo; whirlpool
that are of great interest. Logs are sometimes caught in the
whirlpool, where the fierce spinning round to which they are subjected
rapidly wears away the ends to sharp points, just as they would be if
turned in a lathe.</p>
<p>Of the approach to and general aspect of the cataract, the
view from above is a fine one, for here the river after making a wide
and grand sweep makes an abrupt turn and takes a forty-foot plunge
in a solid mass. In continuous succession below is one fall after
another until a total descent of 80 feet is reached. The water rushes
through a high and winding chasm after it falls by rocky walls that
are perpendicular. From the first fall to the last the water is lashed
into angry sheets of foam; and no matter from where viewed, the
scene is impressive and striking, and holds the onlooker spellbound.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_156">
<img src="images/p0176.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="629" />
</div>
<p>The full significance of the Indian
legend connected with this locality will be
realized as the gaze goes over the whole
mass of turbulent and seething water.
The legend, in brief, is this:&mdash;</p>
<p>Long ago a great war party of 500
Mohawks came by Temiscouata Lake and
the Madawaska River to destroy the
Maliceet village of Medoctec on the St.
John. Before they reached the mouth of
the Madawaska they surprised a Maliceet
hunter with his family. The man and his
family were instantly killed, but the woman
was spared on condition that she should guide the war party to the
doomed village by a safe path. (One version has it that it was a
Maliceet maiden who was thus captured.) She was placed in the
chief&rsquo;s canoe and guided them safely over the portage by the Madawaska
Falls and into the St. John River.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>

<div class="img" id="pic_158">
<img src="images/p0178.jpg" alt="" width="605" height="500" />
<p class="caption">At Hawkshaw Bridge</p>
</div>
<p>Assured by their guide that there were no more falls to pass,
the canoes were lashed together and drifted down the tide while the
weary Mohawks sank in slumber. By and bye a sound of falling
water aroused one of the chiefs; but being told that it was only the
noise of the waterfall at the mouth of a nearby river, he again slept.
But suddenly the full roar of the tremendous cataract strikes on the
ears of the sleepers. Springing to their feet the horror of the situation
is at once apparent. Paddles are seized and frantic efforts are
made to stem the fierce tide. It is useless, and a terrible cry of
despair goes up as they are swept to the brink of the foaming cataract.
She had saved her father and her native village:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Then with a shout of triumph, the Indian maiden cried,</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Listen, ye Mohawk warriors, which sail on Death&rsquo;s dark tide!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p class="t0">Never shall earth grave hold you, or wife weep o&rsquo;er your clay.</p>
<p class="t0">Come to your doom, ye Mohawks, and I will lead the way.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="lcenter"><span class="gs">* * * * *</span></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And many a day thereafter, beyond the torrent&rsquo;s roar,</p>
<p class="t0">The swarthy Mohawk dead were found along the river&rsquo;s shore.</p>
<p class="t0">But on brave Malabeam&rsquo;s dead face no human eyes were set&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">She lies in the dark stream&rsquo;s embrace, the river claims her yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The waters of five hundred years have flowed above her grave,</p>
<p class="t0">But daring deeds can never die while human hearts are brave.</p>
<p class="t0">Her tribe still tell the story, and round their council fires,</p>
<p class="t0">Honor the name of her who died to rescue all their sires.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Almost needless to state, there are many other legends and
tales of the Indians in connection with their villages that are on the
banks of the St. John above and below Fredericton. The whole
district is so full of beauty, has so many attractions for the vacationist
and nature lover, and is such a superb centre for hunting, fishing,
boating, canoeing, etc., that no one may hope to exhaust its
possibilities, even if a lifetime of summers should be spent in the
exploration and unfolding of all that it contains.</p>

<div class="img" id="pic_160">
<img src="images/p0181.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="403" />
</div>
<p>Leaving Fredericton at 8 o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, a start is made on the trip
down the river to the city of St. John,
the commercial centre of the province
and greatest shipping port on the Bay
of Fundy.</p>
<p>The journey is full of interest and
variety. There are numerous stops on
each side of the river, and few daylight trips of eight or nine hours
can be taken elsewhere that will compare with this in pleasure. As
the boat cleaves the waters of the winding and continually-widening
waterway, new incidents mark each mile of its progress.</p>
<p>Here is a small tug whose engine capacity is out of all proportion
to its size. It is towing a huge raft of timber, and, notwithstanding
the heavy pull, is making good progress upstream
and against the current. Now, the deep and wide Oromocto River
is reached, and a busy scene is enacted at the wharf as all hands on
the steamer are pressed into the work of loading produce of every
kind on board.</p>
<p>We go only a short distance across stream before reaching
another landing, where squash, cucumbers and other vegetables
by the barrel, and in immense quantities, are loaded on the lower
decks.</p>
<p>Now a wharf is neared where, it so happens, there are no
passengers awaiting the steamer, and none to get off. A man puts
off in a small boat and makes fast to our boat, well out in the river,
transfers some crates of tomatoes&mdash;the vessel still in motion and
pushes back to the shore.</p>
<p>Nearing a spot where meadow and rolling upland mark a
particularly rich agricultural district, a great flat barge or hay-boat
is almost ahead, and the steamer slows up to give the boat an
opportunity for coming alongside. She is loaded with fine-looking
pressed hay, fresh from the fields and done up in the usual bales
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
which are piled on the low boat to
such a height as almost to be level
with the decks of the large river
steamer. No sooner is the barge
made fast than men pour out on to
the hay, and, while we are still proceeding
on our downward course the
product of the meadow is quickly
stowed away below. It seems only
a minute or two before the empty
float rises high out of the water, and saluting the two men with a
wave of the hand as they cast off, we go ahead under full steam.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_161">
<img src="images/p0182a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="399" />
</div>
<p>A garden country now comes into view, where fair plots of all
kinds of vegetable growth greet the eye in great profusion as we
pull inshore. The wharf is stacked with hundreds of barrels of fresh
corn and other produce destined for St. John as a consuming and
distributing point. There is barely room to move about, but the
united forces of steamer crew and wharf gang make short work of
the huge stack, and in a few minutes all is nicely stowed away
on the lower decks. Ingenious packers they must be down there
to stow away such immense quantities so quickly.</p>
<p>Here a delightful little point is passed, dotted with bungalows
and having trim yachts and smart launches moored offshore in a
snug little cove. A very pretty picture of comfort, cool breezes and
aquatic pleasures it makes, and we are just turning out into midstream
when a mellow-toned salute from an upstream passenger
boat greets the ear. Passing to the offshore side of our boat a fine
full view is had of a St. John River steamboat churning a way to
Fredericton at full speed, freighted with a goodly company of happy
people all engaged with the superb views of the noble river.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_162">
<img src="images/p0182b.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="326" />
</div>
<p>And now a trading sloop passes by so close that we can call to
and converse with her crew; and here, as elsewhere, evidence is found
of the general courtesy and happy
disposition of Maritime Province
people, for the men of the small craft
crowd to her side and wave their hands
in pleasant greeting&mdash;as much as to
say, &ldquo;You are on the famous St.
John; enjoy it as we do that have been
on it all our lives, and love it dearly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A word to the happy brides
and devoted grooms who spread
off over summer highways and byways
from June to September, and
who appreciate ideal and romantic
scenery on routes that are not too
crowded for comfort, and who like,
at times, a little isolation. The St.
John River steamers are roomy and
capacious, and they have many little nooks and corners where there is
just room for two, with a little squeezing, and from which the scenery
may be enjoyed with that quiet and ideal environment so suited for the
&ldquo;two hearts that beat like one.&rdquo; The little spot near the Captain&rsquo;s
wheelhouse deserves to be called &ldquo;Bride&rsquo;s Corner.&rdquo; It is so used,
again and again, and from this delightful coign a full view of the
river may be had, and it is also a quiet point of observation for
viewing life on the forward deck of the steamer.</p>
<p>What if it is breezy at times, so that a wisp of golden hair
passes feathery fingers over the bronzed cheek of the happy groom!
What if summer gusts festoon her chiffon veil so that clearer view
of peachy cheeks is revealed, and what if that filmy and insubstantial
shoulder-wrap is displaced by a particularly lively current that
comes from the nearby valley! Surely the happy man does not
object to the delightful opportunities thus given for adjusting refractory
draperies, and for holding them in place with his arm around
her shoulder when the gusts are heaviest. Ah! me.... &ldquo;Bless you,
my children,&rdquo; we whisper in benediction. &ldquo;May your life ever be
like a voyage on the tranquil St. John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is a charming spot, Camp Bedford, only seventeen
miles from St. John, and just the place for the summer homes or
bungalows of those who like some social life, and who do not wish
to &ldquo;commune with nature&rdquo; alone in some more remote spot.
A number of pleasant cottages line the heights by the shore, and
as the occupants throng the wharf to greet us, the enjoyment
they find in life is reflected in their happy faces.</p>
<p>And so with the numerous choice spots that now follow
quickly as our destination looms up more nearly. Here the great
river widens out to large proportions; and as we pass the frowning
cliffs and massive rocks that mark a way to the harbor, it is apparent
that few ports have such fine approaches as this, few rivers can
match this for scenery&mdash;scenery that is unique and all its own. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
steamer ties up at St. John at
what is locally known as Indian-town.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_165">
<img src="images/p0185.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="379" />
</div>
<p>The St. John may fairly be
termed an Imperial River, for at
different times in the past it has
&ldquo;annexed&rdquo; large portions of other
great rivers, and turned their waters
into her own. Both the Restigouche
and Miramichi Rivers lost heavily
in this way. The length of the river is nearly 450 miles, and
no better trip could be planned anywhere than one up to the
head waters of this great waterway.</p>
<p>The city of St. John was formerly called Parr Town, but was
finally named from the great stream whose mouth it guards. De
Monts and Champlain discovered and named the St. John River in
the year 1604, or some seventy years after Jacques Cartier&rsquo;s exploration
of the St. Lawrence. That arm of the Atlantic in front of St.
John, and known as the Bay of Fundy, was originally named La
Baye Fran&ccedil;oise by De Monts. On Dochet&rsquo;s Island in Passamaquoddy
Bay the exploration party under De Monts passed a severe
winter. The following summer they left the neighborhood and
founded a colony at Port Royal in a protected basin on the south
shore of the Bay of Fundy. Nearly thirty years later a fort was
built near the mouth of the St. John River by Charles La Tour, a
man who had much to do with the development of the then French
province of Acadia, and whose wife Frances earned undying fame
by her noble defense of the St. John Fort while La Tour was absent
in Boston.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Of all the gallant Frenchmen whose names and deeds endure</p>

<p>The French occupation gave way to the English about the
middle of the eighteenth century, but the real settlement of St.
John was made by United Empire Loyalists, or expatriated loyalists
from New England, at the close of the American Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>St. John is a very homelike and
pleasant city where cool sea breezes
may be enjoyed all through the summer.
It has restful small park areas or
squares, as well as extensive outlying
parks and public gardens, and it is
surrounded by a wealth of drives,
resorts, boating places, beaches and
places where all kinds of outdoor sport
may be enjoyed. In addition, over one hundred outlying places of
much interest are readily accessible from it as a centre, and for
fishing and hunting it occupies a position only exceeded by those of
the great sporting districts. For maritime pleasures, deep-sea
fishing, etc., it shares supremacy with two or three other places such
as Halifax and Sydney. It has good hotel and other accommodation,
and for chance wet days it has a most excellent public library. In
this connection may also be mentioned the Museum of the Natural
History Society on Union Street.</p>
<p>It was at the foot of what is now King Street, the principal
store thoroughfare, that the American Loyalists landed in 1783 and
founded the city. What are presumed to be the remains of earthworks
marking the site of Fort La Tour may be seen in West St.
John at the foot of Middle Street. It was here that La Tour&rsquo;s wife,
the &ldquo;Heroine of Acadia,&rdquo; made such a gallant defense of her husband&rsquo;s
cause. She is supposed to have been buried somewhere
near where Governor Villebon is known to have been interred. In
this connection the old French cannon on Queen Square is believed
to have been taken from the French fortifications, and it is altogether
likely to have been one of those to which Whittier referred in his
poem, &ldquo;St. John,&rdquo; on Charles La Tour and the noble Lady La Tour:</p>

<p>Fort Frederick, built by the
British, and now generally known as
the &ldquo;Old Fort,&rdquo; stands on the site of
the former Fort La Tour. On the Carleton
Heights stands a Martello Tower
erected by the British about one hundred
years ago. It is well worth a
visit, and the caretaker has an interesting
collection on view inside. There
is an excellent view from the top of the tower. At Jemseg up the
river an old French fort was occupied by Villebon, before he abandoned
it for the fort he built on the Nashwaak, opposite Fredericton.</p>
<p>The harbor of St. John is deep and large, and shipping from
all parts of the world may regularly be seen at its wharves. Its
waters have been the scene of many a naval engagement in times
long gone by. The famous &ldquo;Reversing Falls,&rdquo; the only phenomenon
of the kind in all the world, may be seen at the huge rocky pass
where the St. John pours out its great flood into the harbor. An
immense body of water passes through this channel, representing
the natural river drainage of over 25,000 square miles of country.
It is not a fall as ordinarily understood, nor a sheer drop from high
to low level. The outlet, though wide, is not sufficiently large to
admit the inflow of the tidal water. The tide packs up, therefore,
and falls into the river. In the same way the tide recedes in the
harbor much faster than it can escape from the river channel,
and at such time the fall is outward. Apart from the curiosity
of such a strange sight, there is much beauty in the view from
the Suspension Bridge. The view of the river from the Fairville
side is very good, and the general scene from Prospect Point is also
excellent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>There is a spot below the Fall where a rocky cavity causes a
whirlpool effect at times. It was known in La Tour&rsquo;s time, and
was called the &ldquo;Pot.&rdquo; Floating timber was often caught in it and
confined in a floating circle for days and weeks. One great tree is
known to have been impounded there for many years. In connection
with that tree it is told that the Indians called it Manitou,
or &ldquo;the Devil.&rdquo; To propitiate the evil spirit that lodged&mdash;as they
thought&mdash;within it, they offered homage of beaver skins, which they
attached to the tree with an arrow head made of sharpened moose
bone.</p>

<p>Rockwood Park is quite close
to the city, and is a delightful
place in which to spend summer
days. It is quite extensive, and is
particularly interesting from the
fact that it is full of natural beauty,
having hill and dale, little glens
and waterfalls, ponds, bridges, terraces,
etc., and a variety of features
that make it an attractive spot.
There is rarely any crowd there, and those who love pleasant walks
under shady trees, with a fine prospect in addition, may take a book
and enjoy country repose on the very threshold of the city. Lily
Lake is a pleasant sheet of water, within the park and not far from
the entrance. The rocky fall at one end of it is very picturesque,
and the climb down reveals a pretty scene. Five other lakes have
been constructed to form a feeding chain for the park lake, and
these, with the numerous paths and roads that are laid out to them
and through the rocks, glens and lakes, add greatly to the recreational
resources of the park. If it is visited several times, a complete
circuit of its beauties may gradually be made, and the views of
the surrounding country, and those of the Bay of Fundy waters, will
well repay all who engage in the delightful occupation. The opportunities
for rambles, secluded walks, and for discovering many
a charming spot, are almost unlimited.</p>
<p>The Public Gardens are at the west end of the park, and a
pleasant hour or two may be well spent in either ramble or rest, to
view the floral clusters so tastefully displayed.</p>
<p>There are golf, tennis and yachting clubs in or near the city;
and unlimited opportunities for the enjoyment of sailing, yachting,
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
boating and canoeing are found on
different nearby waters suited to each
preferred form of aquatic recreation.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_170">
<img src="images/p0190.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="501" />
</div>
<p>Nearby Bay Shore beaches are
found at Seaside Park, Blue Rock,
Broad View and Bay Shore. These
are all reached quite easily by street
railway or ferry.</p>
<p>Trout fishing is free at the
fine expanse of lakes known as Loch
Lomond. There are hotels at which
to stop and from which boats may
be hired. A drive of about eleven miles is necessary to reach the
first lake. There are many other choice lakes and streams where
the fishing rights are private. As a general statement permission
to fish in many of the private waters may be obtained on application
at the Tourist Bureau in the city.</p>
<p>There are many pretty drives along the country roads to
nearby places. One of these is by way of Adelaide Street to
Milledgeville on the Kennebecasis River, where will be found the
club house of the Royal Kennebecasis Yacht Club. The return may
be made by Ragged Point, for the sake of the fine view from there
of river and islands with boats and vessels of every description
passing in all directions. Another is to Indian Town, Pleasant
Point, Fairville, the Suspension Bridge and Reversing Fall; crossing
the bridge and returning by way of Douglas Avenue with its lawns
and comfortable homes. By crossing on the Carleton Ferry many
pleasant roads are available, and in this direction the Bay Shore
may be reached where there are pleasant coves and bathing places.
Still another is to &lsquo;Three Mile House,&rsquo; and Rothesay on the Kennebecasis
River. Then Adam&rsquo;s and McConnell Lakes, Loch Lomond,
Golden Grove and Chamber&rsquo;s Lake, as well as the Bay of Fundy,
by way of Black River Road and Enchanted Lake, are pleasant
drives. Good views of the city are obtained from Fort Howe Hill
and from the heights of Mt. Pleasant.</p>

<p>The best way to enjoy all that St. John contains is to settle
down quietly in a comfortable hotel or other stopping-place, call at
the Tourist Bureau, register and obtain their St. John Booklet with
map, purchase McAlpine&rsquo;s Road Map of St. John, N.B., and County,
and then become familiar with the city and environs by using the
street railway, and taking rambles from place to place. Helpful
maps also are the St. John River Steamship Co.&rsquo;s, showing the
places on the river as far up as Fredericton; the Kennebecasis Steamship
Co.&rsquo;s, showing the Kennebecasis River as far as Hampton, and
the May Queen Steamship Co.&rsquo;s, showing Grand and Washademoak
Lakes, and the places between St. John and Chipman. With these
at hand the surrounding topography will soon be known, and a
logical plan of operations can soon be planned out. There are other
river steamboats with short runs, and still others that make occasional
excursions; but particulars relating to these are best obtained
on the spot.</p>
<p>The favorite sea trips are those to Digby by Dominion Atlantic
ferry Prince Rupert, and to lovely Campobello, pleasant
Eastport and picturesque Grand Manan (island of bold and romantic
cliffs) by the Grand Manan Steamboat Co. There are trips also
to Parrsboro and Kingsport on the Minas Basin at the head of the
Bay of Fundy.</p>
<p>Many of those who reach St. John by sea, principally from
the West, make it the whole object of their trip, sojourning there,
taking local excursions and finally returning over the route by which
they came. Others, of course, make a stay there, and then visit the
interior by way of the St. John River to Fredericton, going over the
Intercolonial Railway from thence to Miramichi Bay and Bay of
Chaleur, and so on to Quebec and the St. Lawrence. Or they pass
over the St. John-Moncton division of the Intercolonial to Nova
Scotia, Prince Edward Island or Cape Breton. Wherever they go
they will find Indian villages and encampments; and a few words on
this feature of Maritime Province life will not be amiss here.</p>
<p>Visitors who wish to enjoy their vacation to its full extent
should not make the mistake of taking a flying trip through an
Indian village. Our life would not be understood by a stranger
who took only a momentary glimpse of it, and this is true in a much
greater degree of Indian life. The Indian does not live nearly so
much on the surface as we do, for he is silent and uncommunicative;
and we are apt to err in judging from superficial observation that
there is little in his life worthy of note.</p>
<p>The Indian has to be drawn out. Gain his confidence&mdash;let
the newness of strangership wear off gradually&mdash;go and be piloted
by him over many a foaming rapid&mdash;go with him in the woods&mdash;share
a tent with him under the moon by night&mdash;put up your own tent
near his village, and visit his humble little home&mdash;do all this, and
you will learn much.</p>

<p>Some of the older Indians have a natural dignity and beauty

incidents of their lives; and if you are patient and gain their confidence,
tales they have heard and the traditions of their fathers will

<p>It is, of course, difficult to understand an Indian properly in
any tongue other than his own. His English is often broken and
peculiar. Here is a &ldquo;snake story&rdquo; just as told by a Maliceet:
&ldquo;From dis landin&rsquo;, &rsquo;bout tree, may be four mile, I s&rsquo;pose, dere&rsquo;s a
loggin&rsquo; road. &rsquo;Bout nine years
ago, in de fall, I was goin&rsquo; down
dat road with Archy Lodge, when
we saw big pine log lyin&rsquo; right
cross de road. Archy he say,
&lsquo;s&rsquo;pose we have chop dat log to
get team by.&rsquo; I say, &lsquo;Yes, s&rsquo;pose&rsquo;;
an&rsquo; Archy he get off an&rsquo; go to git
de axe. Den dat tree he move
right out de road, an&rsquo; go trough
de brush like de devil, an&rsquo; break
down maple saplin&rsquo;s big&rsquo;s my arm.
So &rsquo;twas a big snake!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_174">
<img src="images/p0195.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="497" />
</div>
<p>Maliceet Indians are now found chiefly on the St. John
River and its tributaries. The Micmacs are found in eastern
parts of New Brunswick, and in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward
Island. The Micmacs are not a cross between the Irish and Scotch&mdash;as
has been humorously remarked might be thought from their
name. Both Maliceet and Micmac trace their descent from the
great Algonquin nation.</p>
<p>Indians are eloquent. Read the reply of the old Maliceet
chief to the Government Commissioners who were sent to dispossess
the Indians of their lands at Medoctec on the St. John. The commissioners
asked: &ldquo;By what right or title do you hold these lands?&rdquo;
The old chief, with knowledge of right on his side, pointed to the
little enclosures by the river as he gravely said, &ldquo;There are the
graves of our grandfathers! There are the graves of our fathers!
There are the graves of our children!&rdquo; To this argument the
commissioners could make no reply, and the Indians were left in
possession.</p>

<p>An Indian courtship was formerly a very simple affair. If a
young brave decided to marry&mdash;his
relatives approving&mdash;he would
go into the wigwam where an
&ldquo;eligible&rdquo; maiden lived, and look
at her without saying one word.
If he liked her appearance he tossed
a chip into her lap. This was
&ldquo;popping the question.&rdquo; The
maiden would shyly pretend to
examine it closely while taking
covert glances to &ldquo;size up&rdquo; her
admirer. If &ldquo;smitten,&rdquo; she would
throw the chip at him with a
pleasant smile, and then nothing was
wanting but the service of the priest
to bind the marriage tie. If, however,
the young brave was not a
man to her liking, the chip would
be tossed aside with a frown, and he would then be obliged to seek
elsewhere.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_177">
<img src="images/p0197.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="343" />
</div>
<p>A full wedding ceremony took place in the following way.
On the appointed day the happy brave, accompanied by his relatives,
went to the bride and her assembled friends. She was &ldquo;given away&rdquo;
by her father, and was then dressed in a handsome costume, a present
from the groom. All then took their way to the village green to
participate in the wedding dance, at which the whole village was
present. The following day the newly-wedded pair started on a
canoe honeymoon trip. At some choice spot, chosen for its beauty
and romantic surroundings, both knelt together and made vows
of unending affection, The neighborhood of some great rock was
always preferred, and the enduring rock was invoked to witness the
vows thus made. A tree was rarely chosen because of its being
more perishable than a rock.</p>
<p>The superior civilization of the Indian knows little of infidelity,
and nothing of divorce.</p>
<p>All the Indian peoples of Canada had, and still have,
superstitious and strange fancies. Animals, plants, mountains, rivers
and great rocks were supposed to have indwelling spirits. They
were, therefore, treated with respect. Even to animals of the
chase, such as bear and beaver, etc., they would offer an apology
for the necessary pursuit. Fishing-nets were even included in a
ceremony which consisted of an address to the fish begging them
to take courage and be caught, soothing them also by the promise
that due respect should be paid to their bones. Plants had souls,
the Indians believed; and, in addition, they held the belief that elves
and fairies of great beauty and marvellous powers dwelt in hill and
valley. The high mountain tops were supposed to be inhabited by
gods with wonderful attributes; and the sound of thunder, the voice
of the rapid, and the roar of the great cataract were all manifestations
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
to them of individual divinities. Above all was the overruling
Manitou or Great Spirit.</p>
<p>The Indian settlements on the St. John River and elsewhere
in New Brunswick, as well as in Nova Scotia, etc., are well worth a
visit; and all who wish to understand the life and ways of those who
have so well been named &ldquo;Children of the Forest,&rdquo; should give some
time to a pleasing form of recreation that is sure to bring many
hours of happiness in its train.</p>

<p>The trip by steamboat from St. John
up the Kennebecasis will have given
many a view, distant and near, of the
beautiful valley and the garden country
surrounding it. The course of the river
steamboat is to the west of Long Island,
and hence of such pretty suburbs as
Renforth and Rothesay only distant
glimpses may be had. Hampton is the
head of steam navigation; but the river
runs up to Norton, Apohaqui, Sussex
and beyond, in all of which places
pretty views may be seen. These places, therefore, are best seen
from the Intercolonial Railway, which passes through the heart of
the several districts; and, in addition, the road runs up to Petitcodiac
village and along by the river of that name as far as Moncton.</p>
<p>Renforth, Rothesay, Hampton and the various summer
resort in the vicinity of St. John lying on or near the Kennebecasis
are all pleasant vacation spots, justly prized by the inhabitants of the
prosperous city for which they provide such convenient and delightfully
situated country places.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_181">
<img src="images/p0200b.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="409" />
</div>
<p>At Renforth there is a choice little cove or bay where summer
cottages face riverwards along a breezy ridge that follows the course
of the stream at this point; while at Rothesay the bungalows are
very prettily disposed in the woods by
the shore, and on the pleasant slopes
above. At both of these places good
boating, sailing, and canoeing may be
had, as well as motor boating. River
bathing is enjoyed by nearly all who
summer in these charming spots. While
not so cool as seaside places, they are
appreciably cooler than town or city,
and on that account they have become
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
favorite resorts for St. John people, as well
as for others from more distant points.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_182">
<img src="images/p0201.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Above Rothesay the railroad strikes
inland a mile or two from the river, but at
Jubilee and Nauwigewauk it resumes its river
course and holds it until near Hampton,
where it is about a mile from the part of
the village that fronts on the water. Hampton,
however, may be said to run almost
from the station to the river, and with the pleasant inn or summer
hotel close by the station, the pretty village, the Court-House
green, and the splendid view from the hills, together with the
many shady walks, this part of the village has many attractions.</p>
<p>Hampton is the head of Kennebecasis River navigation for
steamboats; and as all the pleasant resorts just named are either
on the river or near it, those who summer in this neighborhood
will soon become familiar with the enjoyable scenery of the Kennebecasis.
At Hampton-by-the-River, it should be added, there is a
comfortable homelike hotel or stopping-place. The surroundings
of the whole village are all picturesque, and such as conduce to
pleasure in walks, drives and rambles.</p>
<p>An enjoyable water outing may be taken on the river by
boarding the steamboat at Hampton and going downstream to St.
John. At first a way is threaded through the meadows by a varied
channel that makes it necessary to &ldquo;double&rdquo; and often head in an
opposite direction, to pass some island or follow the devious windings
of a stream that makes bends and turns and double-bends in its
course. At last the meadows are passed, however, and a typical
river course with regular channel is entered. Here high hills and
steep ridges line the way. The view at Clifton is very fine, and at
Moss Glen and Chapel Grove it is almost equally good. As St. John
is neared the steamboat passes
into the waters of the larger river
and takes its way past the Boar&rsquo;s
Head, and round south to the
Indiantown Wharves.</p>

<p>From Hampton a short
railroad runs to St. Martin&rsquo;s and
Quaco on the Bay of Fundy shore.
St. Martin&rsquo;s is a favorite excursion
point that is readily reached by a
short sea journey from St. John.
Quaco, almost immediately joining on
the south, has a very pretty harbor.
Bold cliffs and little stony beaches
are prominent features in its attractive
scenery.</p>

<img src="images/p0203.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="430" />
</div>
<p>Journeying north-east from
Hampton along the line of the
Intercolonial Railway the course of the upper Kennebecasis River
is approximately followed by way of Norton, Apohaqui and Sussex
through a very pleasant pastoral country. These are all excellent
summer places, and from nearly all of them fishing is within easy
reach. From Norton a short railroad runs through choice country
to Grand Lake, Chipman and the Salmon and Gaspereau Rivers.
Apohaqui has a favorable situation at the mouth of the branching
Millstream, while the smart little town of Sussex has a delightful
site with its own pretty little waterway stretching off through the
Sussex Vale to the southeast.</p>
<p>After leaving Penobsquis the railroad soon crosses North
River, and the upper waters of the Petitcodiac; then following a
course first west and then north of the Petitcodiac River, it reaches
Moncton. Petitcodiac is not only a pretty village itself, but it has
much romantic scenery surrounding it. The Pollet River Falls
to the south-east are well worth seeing, and the river itself invites
to many a ramble.</p>
<p>At Salisbury a short railroad runs east to Hillsboro on the
Petitcodiac River, and from thence in a southerly direction along
the west shore of Chignecto Bay to Albert, Harvey and Alma. The
country round about Albert is very picturesque, and Alma on the
Bay Shore is an attractive village. The peculiar Hopewell Cape
Rocks are generally reached by driving from Hillsboro. Ample
recreation is found through this district in fishing, walking, and
driving; and there is boating on Chignecto Bay, etc.</p>
<p>Few would recognize the progressive and prosperous city of
Moncton as the place that originally came into being under the
modest name of &ldquo;The Bend.&rdquo; The name applied to the river, Petitcodiac,
which seems a blending of French and Indian, means a
&ldquo;bend.&rdquo; Soon after the middle of the eighteenth century the place
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
was named after General Monckton, once Lieutenant-General of
Nova Scotia, who had served at Louisbourg, served also as second in
command under General Wolfe at the taking of Quebec, and who
later was British Governor of New York.</p>

<p class="caption">On the Kennebecasis River</p>
</div>
<p>Some of the early settlers of &ldquo;The Bend,&rdquo; as Moncton was then
known, came from Philadelphia and the Delaware River in pre-revolutionary
days. One of these early settlers built a log house on
the spot where now stands the railway round-house. Some United
Empire Loyalists assisted in the settlement
later on. The place had a
gradual growth until 1872, when it
commenced a new life by becoming an
Intercolonial Railway centre, with workshops,
etc., and to-day, as a consequence,
it is an important town, full of
life and vitality.</p>

<p class="caption">Moncton&mdash;General Offices of the Intercolonial Railway through the Trees</p>
</div>
<p>The management and administration of the Intercolonial
Railway, as well as the clerical, constructive and auxiliary staffs,
all centre in Moncton. As a consequence, about 2500 of the town&rsquo;s
population are in Intercolonial employ.</p>
<p>The General Offices of the Railway occupy a prominent
position adjoining the station grounds. The building has recently
been extended to give much needed room, and with its pleasant
surroundings gives comfortable quarters for the working staff of
the system.</p>
<p>The city bears on its face every evidence of prosperity, and
it has many excellent stores and pleasant residential streets.</p>
<p>The Moncton and Buctouche Railway has its headquarters
here; and Moncton is also the eastern terminus of one of Canada&rsquo;s
trans-continental railway systems, the Grand Trunk Pacific.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of the Bay of Fundy &ldquo;Tidal Bore&rdquo; is best
seen on the Petitcodiac River at Moncton. The rise and fall of
the tide here shows a difference of thirty feet between extreme high
and extreme low. At favorable times the height of the incoming
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
wall of water, or &ldquo;bore,&rdquo; is between four and five feet. At such times
it is a very wonderful and interesting sight.</p>
<p>There are a number of pleasant walks and drives in and
around the city, with drives of a more extended character to Shediac
and Hopewell Cape and Rocks. By rail, too, it is easy to reach
many pleasant spots in a very short time.</p>
<p>Many will be surprised to learn that there are splendid oil
and gas fields in the neighborhood of Moncton. A number of
wells have been drilled, and some are exceedingly productive.</p>
<p>The importance of this development will be understood from
the mere statement of the present capacity of the gas wells, which
is fifty millions of cubic feet daily; nor does this represent a maximum
capacity, for the industry is just in its infancy; the first public
consumption of gas in Moncton dating only from the year 1912.</p>
<p>The Intercolonial Railway uses nearly two million feet of gas
daily in its workshops, and manufacturing plants generally are
hastening to adopt gas as a substitute for coal. As is well known,
gas is much more efficient and economical than coal as a fuel; and
the product of the local gas wells is of excellent quality, its thermal
value being high. A striking modern example of the use of gas fuel
is demonstrated in Moncton, for here the electric power for street
railway purposes, for the pumping station at the waterworks and
for street and domestic lighting is all generated economically through
the use of gas as a fuel.</p>
<p>Although natural gas is used so generally by manufacturers
and residents of Moncton, and is also piped into the village of
Hillsboro, in Albert County, its use is less than ten per cent. of the
yielding capacity of the present gas wells. It is also believed that
other wells will be discovered, and many experts are of the opinion
that the gas field has merely been tapped on the fringe.</p>
<p>The early expansion of Moncton as a manufacturing and
residential centre will be apparent to those who study economic
conditions, for in addition to the low cost of gas as a fuel for manufacturing
and general power purposes, the use of it as a substitute
for coal in the important detail of house heating in winter shows a
saving of over eighty-five per cent.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that from Newcastle and Chatham
Junction a course by the Miramichi River was traced, followed by
another along the Nashwaak to Fredericton. From that point a
further course was traced down the lower St. John River to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
city of St. John, and thence to
Rothesay, Hampton, Sussex and
Petitcodiac to Moncton.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_190">
<img src="images/p0208.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="391" />
</div>
<p>Starting now from the Miramichi
River and Chatham Junction
and proceeding along the main line
to Moncton, a section of country
is traversed that is inland from
the Northumberland Straits Coast
a varying distance of twenty to
twenty-five miles. The railway
line in its progress crosses the main Barnaby River as well as its
upper waters, bridges the Kouchibouguac, the Kouchibouguacis
and the Richibucto Rivers, and passes over the headwaters of the
Canaan, Buctouche, Cocagne and North streams. At Kent Junction
railroad connection is made for Richibucto and St. Louis; and from
Moncton a line runs to Buctouche.</p>
<p>Richibucto and St. Louis are Acadian settlements, the former
a prosperous place from which timber is shipped. There is bathing
not far from Richibucto, with boating and other shore recreation.</p>
<p>Some of the small streams between the Barnaby River
and Moncton are used for logging in the spring, the headwaters
of some of them being not over twelve feet wide.
In places where the river has not risen high enough, the
logs may be seen packed side-by-side, like matches, or
piled high in a confused heap with projecting timbers, presenting
the appearance of a <i>chevaux-de-frise</i>. With a heavy rainfall, however,
these streams swell to considerable proportions; and the logs
are easily borne down to the mills, and to the coast, with some
attention here and there to free the timber when it jams.</p>
<p>Buctouche, at the mouth of the river of that name, is a little
Acadian watering place about two hours&rsquo; run from Moncton over
the Moncton and Buctouche Railway.</p>
<p>In a north-easterly direction from Moncton the line of the
Intercolonial Railway reaches Painsec Junction. The main line
here passes to the east, after throwing off a short branch that leads
to Shediac and Point du Ch&ecirc;ne.</p>
<p>Shediac is a pleasant town situated on a broad harbor, sheltered
by Shediac Island. It has a good sand beach, and is celebrated
for its fine oysters. There is excellent fishing here, both in
fresh and salt water. The place was once strongly garrisoned by
French troops.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>North of Shediac is a large Acadian settlement, the Cocagnes,
reached by coast road, or by boat around Cocagne Cape and into the
mouth of the Cocagne River. East of Shediac are other interesting
Acadian villages; these also are accessible by coast road and boat.</p>
<p>Point du Ch&ecirc;ne is well placed as a pleasant little Summer
place for boating, etc., but it is chiefly known as the place of departure
for the passenger steamships crossing the Northumberland
Straits to Summerside, Prince Edward Island. Steamships for
other parts of the same island leave from Pictou, some 140 miles
east; but the Point du Ch&ecirc;ne route is preferable for all but those
who come from Cape Breton, Halifax, etc., and the comfortable and
smart-looking steamships of the Prince Edward Island Navigation
Co. that cross from Point du Ch&ecirc;ne to Summerside leave nothing
to be desired in the way of equipment and speed.</p>

</div>
<p>Evening cloud effects of a beautiful
character are frequently seen when crossing
the Straits of Northumberland from
Point du Ch&ecirc;ne to Summerside on Prince
Edward Island. On one occasion it had
threatened rain on leaving the mainland,
but when the steamer was well over and
nearing Summerside the clouds began to
disperse. The sun was about to dip
below the horizon, and its upward slanting
beams gave marvellous coloring to
the dispersing cloud drifts. These assumed the deepest and richest
tints of pink and terra cotta, with an infinite variety of fantastic
forms; and this lovely Prince Edward Island sunset, with all its
gorgeous display of form and color, was the topic of conversation
then and afterwards amongst those on the steamer, and who met
by chance on the Island later on.</p>
<p>In approaching the Island the first feature of the land that
attracts attention is the red sandstone. Red may be termed the
Island&rsquo;s color, for everywhere the red sandstone and the light hue
of the soil&mdash;almost as vivid as the well-known Pompeian clay&mdash;is
to be seen. It affords a beautiful contrast with the vivid green of
the fields and the darker green of the fir and spruce trees that
freshen the landscape.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;er you walk, cool gales shall fan the glade;</p>
<p class="t0">Trees where you sit shall crowd into a shade;</p>
<p class="t0">Where&rsquo;er you tread the blushing flowers shall rise,</p>
<p class="t0">And all things flourish where you turn your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Prince Edward Island has been well christened. It is doubtful
if Cabot ever called there. Jacques Cartier is said to have done
so, however, and it was he who called it the &ldquo;Low and Beautiful
Island.&rdquo; The Indians called it Abegweit, or &ldquo;Resting on the Wave.&rdquo;
Champlain named it L&rsquo;Isle St. Jean; the English rechristened it
after Edward, Duke of Kent, as &ldquo;Prince Edward Island,&rdquo; and it
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
has since been termed the &ldquo;Garden of the
Gulf,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Million Acre Farm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_194">
<img src="images/p0212a.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="500" />
</div>
<p>Together with the Magdalen Islands it
was tentatively settled by the French in 1663,
and was always included as part of Acadia; but
its real settlement dates from the time when
the Acadians came hither after being expelled
from Nova Scotia. Peasants from Bretagne,
Picardy and Normandy participated in the
settlement; and later, English and Scotch settlers
followed. Many hoards of arms, furniture,
cooking utensils, etc., have been found hidden in
the woods, placed there by the early Acadians.</p>
<p>Some ten thousand descendants of this hunted people are
living on the Island, and as they do not readily mix with others, and
thus preserve their old manner of living, they are a very interesting
part of the population. To some extent they live by themselves in
their own villages, speaking the original tongue, wearing the simple
dress and keeping alive the old traditions. They are simple and
kindly, and give color and charm to the more populous communities
that surround them.</p>
<p>In these places the maidens still weave, sew and lay by linen
for the expected marriage; and the simple social gatherings for
weddings, barn-raisings, etc., still attract their people of all ages.
Many of them still believe in &ldquo;Loups-garous&rdquo; and other fictions of
ghost, and haunting spirits, etc. The principal Acadian settlements
are at Rustico, Tignish, Abram&rsquo;s Village, and Miscouche.</p>
<p>The quaint broken English of the old Acadian is shown in this
extract relating to our little friend the grosbeak:</p>

</div>
<p>There are a few hundred Micmac Indians
living along the north shore. They are good
hunters, and an outing with them for trout and
wild birds is a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>The water surrounding the island is shallower
than that of the mainland coast, and on that
account, and because the temperature is higher, the
bathing here is not too cool, and is much enjoyed. It is warmer than
New Brunswick or Nova Scotia&mdash;Atlantic Nova Scotia being the
coolest place of all. The summer temperature of the Island ranges
from 65 to 80 degrees, and higher on exceptional occasions.</p>
<p>It has been remarked that, &ldquo;there will come to the world-weary
tourist visions of a beautiful land in the midst of the cool sea&mdash;a land
fanned by healthful breezes, a land of green hills, purling brooks and
fertile fields. The crowded fashionable watering places have lost their
charm for him, and he yearns for some place of rest and repose
where quiet summer days can be obtained&rdquo;&mdash;and all this is true of
Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p>A recent census of the Island shows the largest population per
thousand of people over seventy years of age in any province of
Canada. In most countries a fourth generation is rare, but Prince
Edward can boast of a fifth. This is the Poirier family of Tignish,
the men are fishermen who all &ldquo;pull together&rdquo; in excellent health.
The head of the family, great-great-grandfather Poirier, has 202
living descendants, and at 97 years of age rises at daylight, turns
his fish on the &ldquo;flakes&rdquo; to dry, and chops and saws his wood.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_197">
<img src="images/p0213a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="335" />
</div>
<p>But we have entered Bedeque Bay, and are at Summerside,
bound for Alberton and Tignish at the western end of the Island.
A very pleasant harbor indeed is this, and the not too pretentious
summer town is nicely laid out with good stores and shady streets.
There is good boating for yachts, sail-boats, launches, row-boats
and canoes, and the life is that of the seaside resort, with pleasant
excursions and an enjoyable social life. The Wilmot and Dunk Rivers
empty into the harbor. On the Dunk
will be found many pretty views; the
fishing, too, is good&mdash;trout of large size.
It was a view of this river that inspired
the couplet:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Pause here&mdash;and look upon a sight as fair,</p>
<p class="t0">As ever painter limned of poet&rsquo;s dreams.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>Everyone in Summerside walks down to the wharf to see the
steamship come in from Point du Ch&ecirc;ne. The usual hour, 7.30
p.m., is convenient for all. The two trains for east and west go
down to meet the steamer and then return to the station to start
their runs. In summer both steamer wharf and train platform are
crowded with the youth and beauty of the town. The scene is
always a lively one.</p>
<p>But a start is made for the west, and the country is almost
immediately reached. Here plenty of evidence is seen of the great
productiveness of these eastern lands, for &ldquo;stooks&rdquo; of wheat are
standing on end in great quantities. At Wellington the small upper
waters of a stream flow northward. It is tributary to the Ellis
River, into which other streams flow. This stream soon widens
out considerably and runs into Richmond or Malpeque Bay on the
north shore. The river and the lakes nearby are all fished, and
lobsters and clams are plentifully found. At Port Hill and adjoining
places, fine-looking sheep are seen in large numbers, grazing
in good pastures, and there are herds of the cleanest cattle in the
fresh-appearing meadows. The land hereabouts is like an almost
level prairie, and everywhere the harvest of wheat and oats meet the
eye in pleasant array; newly gathered and dotting the whole of the
surrounding fields with innumerable sheaves, stacked up on end,
and ready to gather into the barns that will surely be overtaxed&mdash;so
rich and plentiful are the crops of this verdant isle.</p>
<p>In the neighborhood of Portage there are extensive tracts
of young woods, and in places, for miles around, the country resembles
cultivated park lands. In some parts there is plenty of
evidence that heavy timber has formerly been cut down, for, the
harvest work about done, fierce and glowing fires are seen consuming
great tree-stumps to make a perfect clearing.</p>
<p>Mixed trains, usually avoided by all who are not compelled
to use them, are really the best for seeing all the pleasant little by-places
of the Garden Province; for while freight is being handled at
each station, it is possible to alight and ramble a little in nearby
luxurious paths that fringe the railroad along its whole extent. This
applies not only to the route from Summerside to Tignish, but also
to the whole railway system of the Island. As is perhaps generally
known, the Prince Edward Island Railway is part of the extensive
system known as the Canadian Government Railways.</p>

Little girls, too, emboldened by the presence
of their older brothers, pluck up
courage to pass the car windows and
take shy glances at the people from the
great cities. To see their fresh young faces and artless simplicity
of manner is alone well worth the railway fare from some far-off
metropolis.</p>

<p>Extensive dairying farms are seen as Elmsdale is neared.
Pleasant knolls of land spread out in every direction, and the belts
of trees of various tints, as well as the trim orchards, give an attractive
appearance to the whole countryside.</p>
<p>And now Alberton is reached, near to Holland or Cascumpeque
Bay:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The echoes of the surges roar</p>
<p class="t2">About the bar by Alberton.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Alberton is quite an interesting village on the north side of the
Island. Near to it is the Kildare River, and the pretty district of Montrose.
The harbor of Alberton is probably the most available place for
shipping along the whole north shore. American vessels often take
refuge here from heavy storms. A peculiarity of the St. Lawrence Gulf
side of the Island is the absence of good harbors, and the presence of long
and narrow sand bars, or dunes, that lie about a mile or less from
the land towards the western end of the Island, and continue in an
almost unbroken line for a distance of 25 miles or more to the east.
The Indian name Cascumpec, or &ldquo;Floating through Sand,&rdquo; sufficiently
describes the outer waters of many of the rivers that empty
on the northern side. These sand bars have narrow inlets in places
through which small vessels may pass into the protected inner waters
known as lagoons or narrows. The harbor at Alberton has a convenient
entrance, with a lighthouse; and vessels of average size
may enter at any tide. The sand bars towards the eastern end of
the Island are different in character. Instead of being in one long
line with narrow breaks, they are found in completely detached
sections, generally across the mouth of bay or river, and sometimes
making out from the side of a headland to the opposite shore, and
thus nearly closing the entrance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_200">
<img src="images/p0217.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="381" />
</div>
<p>On the outer sides of these sand bars
the waves break with magnificent
surf&mdash;inside all is calm and peaceful.
High cliffs are not found on the northern
shore, but bold land of romantic
appearance is found in places.</p>
<p>The neighborhood of Alberton,
Montrose and the Kildare River is an
attractive one, and many pleasant
walks and drives may here be enjoyed.</p>
<p>A feature of this part of the Island is the numerous &ldquo;fox
farms&rdquo; that, are springing up, where these animals are raised for the
value of their pelts. Large sums have been paid for a pair with
which to start a ranch or farm&mdash;as much as two and three thousand
dollars, it is said.</p>
<p>The climate of Prince Edward Island is well suited for operations
of this kind, and much money has already been made by
those engaged in the business. Several new fox farms have recently
been started in various parts of the island, and as fox breeding
appears to be both interesting and profitable, the number of these
farms is sure to increase.</p>
<p>But we have left Alberton and are making north. That
little hamlet, where we stopped for a few minutes, has houses that
may easily be counted upon two hands; and the young girl with pleasant
face and engaging brown eyes who has just waved a free and ingenuous
&lsquo;good-bye,&rsquo; was the same who waited at our hotel table in Summerside,
a few days since. A week of town life has satisfied her;
and she has gone &ldquo;back to the farm.&rdquo; Sensible girl!...... and
happy father and mother, whose life in the comfortable and snug
little cottage over there is still to be cheered by a bright, youthful
face and sunny smile.</p>

<p>And now, Tignish, the French-Scotch fishing village, and
quietest of quiet little summer resorts;
modest, unpretending, and just what it
appears to be on first arrival, a country
retreat. A place of unbroken sleep and
absolute calm, and where the commotion
and tumult of the world frets
none. A natural sanitarium to which

<p>A tale of French-Indian life by Jessie
Hogg may here be told to show the relations
that existed on the Island between the two
races long ago. &ldquo;Belle Marie&rdquo; was a pretty
Indian maiden who had received that name
from the French people living near the native
village. She was much loved by her
father, the chief of the tribe. She had been
trained by him in Indian arts and was a surer
shot with the arrow than even he. One of
the French officers took great interest in
her as a child, and told her of the Old World and its wonders.
Without knowing it she taught him the lesson of love. Being much
older than she, he was able to keep his feelings a secret. For some
reason she gradually changed, and her former girlish manner became
more demure and maidenly, her eyes became softer and acquired a
new light, and she came less frequently to hear the tales she loved
so well.</p>
<p>A jealous lover of her tribe had told her the officer was only
amusing himself for want of companionship with his own people.</p>
<p>One day the now lonely Frenchman found her in a little rocky
nook on the shore. The sky was clear, and the incoming tide was
gently drawing near unheeded by the maiden, whose thoughts were
far away as she gazed over the water intently, unconscious of the
earnest gaze bent on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belle Marie!&rdquo; he said softly.</p>
<p>She started, and a wave of color told a tale that surely
anyone could have read. Until then her sole lessons had been
learned from the songs of the birds, the winds sighing through the
trees, the perfume of the flowers, and the murmuring of the waters
as they beat upon the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mon Maitre!&rdquo; she replied, as she rose suddenly, pale and
startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been, ma belle?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the woods; on the shore; with my people,&rdquo; was the
disjointed reply, as she looked down at the sand beneath her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not been to see me for so long&mdash;I have missed you
very much. Why did you stay away?&rdquo; He came near.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>She turned with the fury of a young tigress, as she told him he
only talked to her to pass the time away. But suddenly she broke
down, and burst into tears as she covered her face with her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you, Belle Marie!&rdquo; said the officer, in earnest tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love me?&rdquo; she cried&mdash;&ldquo;An Indian maid? A forest girl?
Why, your people would scorn you for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My people are nothing to me now,&rdquo; he sadly replied&mdash;then
drawing near, he asked, &ldquo;Will you marry me, Belle Marie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she bounded off, and disappeared without reply.</p>
<p>One morning, some days after this, she stood at the opening
of his tent. &ldquo;Yes, I will be your wife,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;if you love
me, and me only!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another chapter now opens, for the old chief demurred.
&ldquo;Belle Marie must marry a brave of her own race,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>But finally the love of the Frenchman prevailed, and the old
chief consented to the marriage.</p>
<p>In the meantime Belle Marie&rsquo;s former suitor, the jealous
one who had interfered in the early days, seemed to take it all in
good part.</p>
<p>One day as the happy girl was walking in the distant woods
she came across her affianced, struck down and dying in the snow.
With bursting heart she staggered homewards, bearing him in her
arms. Senseless and almost gone, she nursed him back to life,
assisted by her kind-hearted father. With loving devotion, and
with just enough of sleep and food to maintain life, she nursed the
wounded man to complete recovery.</p>
<p>The wedding was now decided upon without further delay,
and one bright spring morning the ceremony took place in the little
church that had been decorated with ferns and wild-flowers.</p>
<p>Under a bower of leafy branches and fragrant bloom the happy
pair stood. Dozens of canoes lined the shore, and the wedding festivities
were well underway. The low sobbing heard from the assembled
tribe as Belle Marie stood at the altar by the side of the man of
her choice told how much the darling of her tribe would be missed.</p>
<p>Scarce was the ceremony ended, and the two turned away
from the altar, when with a cry that resounded far and near&mdash;a cry
that pierced the hearts of all who heard it&mdash;and one that sent a thrill
of terror to all, Marie threw herself before her husband, shielding
him from view, but not before an arrow, sped with the sure aim that
hatred and revenge could prompt, had found its resting place in her
heart instead of his.</p>

<p>He caught her as she fell, clasped her
close to him with a moan of agony, and in all a
strong man&rsquo;s anguish, called her every endearing
name that love could bring to mind.</p>
<p>But she looked up at him with those
eyes that had always contained such an unutterable
love in their depths, and said slowly
as the life-blood ebbed over altar steps and
floor:&mdash;&ldquo;I ...... saved ...... you. I ..... saw
..... it ...... coming. My ...... own ......
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Returning east to Summerside, and
passing Kensington, with its pretty, stone
station-building, the quiet village of Bradalbane
is reached. This makes a good centre from which to visit the districts
of New London, Mill River, Stanley Bridge, Trout River, New
Glasgow, Hunter River outlet and Rustico. This whole district is
about as pleasant and picturesque as could well be imagined, and
days spent in driving and walking will bring much enjoyment.</p>
<p>From New London harbor in the bay to the north the fishing
boats may be seen putting out to sea:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The wind is blowing freshly up from far-off ocean caves,</p>
<p class="t0">And sending sparkling kisses o&rsquo;er the brows of virgin waves,</p>
<p class="t0">While routed dawn-mists shiver as fast and far they flee,</p>
<p class="t0">Pierced by the shafts of sunrise and the glitter of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_204">
<img src="images/p0220b.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="403" />
</div>
<p>The pretty scenery of Mill Vale, the Trout River and Stanley
Bridge is sure to enchant. A
noticeable feature of this and
other districts is the number
of lovely streams of diminutive
character, and the nearby, always
picturesque, mill ponds. A story
illustrating the method of the bear
when he &ldquo;trees&rdquo; a man, and showing,
also, the intelligence of a
little dog is related of the Stanley
Bridge district.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;Before bridges were built
throughout the Island the rivers
were crossed by ferries, and the
ferry was generally named after the
individual who ran it. Where
Stanley Bridge now is, Fyfe&rsquo;s ferry
formerly plied. Mr. Fyfe was the
owner of a little white dog, of which
he was very proud, and with reason,
for it once saved his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day walking in the
woods near his home he was suddenly
set upon by a huge bear that
was evidently very hungry and was out foraging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ferryman managed to elude his pursuer for a short time,
but the bear was not to be cheated of his prey without making a
good fight. Hard pressed, the now desperate man brought all his
wits to bear on the situation, and he decided to climb a tree which
was the only refuge anywhere near. He lost no time in putting his
plan into execution, but he had forgotten that bears can climb
and Bruin must have thought that he had his victim in the right
place, also. Immediately the animal started up the tree after the
disappearing ferryman, and quickly came within reach. He had only
taken hold of the man&rsquo;s boot-heel when he felt a stinging sensation
at his own pedal extremities. He immediately dropped to the
ground where he recognized in his antagonist the little white dog.
The dog suddenly disappeared, but not out of sight of its master,
whom it was bent on saving from a horrible death. Accordingly,
every time the bear attempted to climb the tree, the dog took hold
of his heel, and finding the pain so severe from the bites, Bruin had
to come down again and again; until, finally, tired out he sat down
to watch his victim whom he had treed. The bear was not to enjoy
this situation long, for the barking of the dog had aroused the fears
of Fyfe&rsquo;s neighbors, who thought something must be wrong, and
started for the scene armed with rifles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking in the situation at a glance they quickly dispatched
Mr. Bruin, and, the danger past, the ferryman came down. Almost
needless to state no kindness was ever too much for the little dog
after that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A change has now come over the scene, for the forests have
fallen before the woodman&rsquo;s axe, and Bruin has also disappeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>

<img src="images/p0223.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="329" />
</div>
<p>The Hunter River, Rustico Bay
and Wheatly River districts are all well
worthy of exploration in drives and walks.
The principal north shore resorts are
Rustico, Tracadie, Stanhope, and Brackley
Point. From nearly all of these
places summer visitors may put out with
the fishermen and join in the cod and
mackerel fishing.</p>
<p>The city of Charlottetown has a fine and most unusual situation.
It is on the East or Hillsborough River, the York or North
River is on its south side, the West or Elliott River joins the York
just a little to the south of the city, and thus all three streams mingle
their waters and pass out into Hillsborough Bay, the Bay being also
near, and almost in front of the Island Capital.</p>
<p>Charlottetown has wide, leafy and pleasant streets, covers
considerable ground, has a delightful atmosphere, and is altogether
one of the most homelike and attractive little cities to be found anywhere.
It suggests the capital of some neat European principality,
with its substantial Queen Square and public buildings grouped
or arranged with such good taste in the park-like heart of the city.
In the square is a monument to the memory of the Prince Edward
Island Volunteers who fell in the South African War. The flower
beds in the open space are neatly laid out and refreshing to the eye.
Here are shady seats where on summer nights one may sit and hear
the music of the band. The principal stores of the city are grouped
along the sides of the square.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_208">
<img src="images/p0223a.jpg" alt="" width="687" height="500" />
</div>
<p>The Provincial Building with its Legislative Halls and excellent
library is a delightful place to visit. The obliging librarian is
ever willing to extend courtesies to the visitor. There is an air of
solidity and quiet dignity as
well as an individuality about
the building that is very agreeable.
It makes a strong appeal
to those who would cherish all
that is good in the old order
of things, and seems a standing
rebuke to the present day of
big things&mdash;to hurry, crush,
noise, confusion, modern &ldquo;rush,&rdquo;
and overcrowded and congested
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
cities&mdash;and while every loyal inhabitant of Charlottetown devoutly
hopes for and believes in the great future growth of the
city, let an admiring stranger, who has tasted its hospitality, express
the fervent wish that it may not grow too large; that for many years
to come it may remain just about as it is&mdash;perfect.</p>
<p>In olden days French sailors who first entered the harbor of
Charlottetown were so pleased with what they saw that they named
it Port la Joie. The surrounding scenery is pleasing, but not impressive.
A general characterization of the Island scenery would
be that of pastoral tranquility, well-tilled fields, verdant pastures
and quiet rivers; with a medium temperature, cool night air and
an ever-present sense of peace, rest and repose over all.</p>
<p>Drives and walks for pleasant air may be taken in many
directions, and there are steamer trips to the Indian encampment
at Rocky Point, where relics of the old French occupation may be
seen; to Southport, to Orwell, to Mount Stewart and Hampton and
other more distant places, as well as to Victoria on the South Shore.
Longer steamboat journeys are those to Quebec and Montreal, and
to Boston by way of Hawkesbury and Halifax. Keppoch, a summer
resort outside of the city, is within easy reach by carriage.</p>
<p>Victoria Park by the waterside is a favorite recreation spot,
for it has winding roadways that are well shaded, and fine views of
the surrounding waters. There are public cricket grounds here,
and tennis courts as well. The Golf Links at Belvidere are well laid
out, and afford much enjoyment for lovers of this fine exercise; and
an excellent view of the East River may be had from here.</p>
<p>A visit to the Farmer&rsquo;s Market will prove especially interesting
to city people.</p>
<p>Boating of all kinds may be had in the rivers and harbor,
and motor-boats and yachts have a wide field for pleasant excursions
on the nearby waters. A fine motor-boat excursion is that to
Bonshaw, up the West River.</p>
<p>In one of the rivers near the city mackerel were once so abundant
that an ox-cart was driven through, and
a full load was obtained with a scoop-net
in crossing.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_209">

</div>
<p>A division of the Prince Edward
Island Railway runs from Charlottetown
to Souris and Georgetown, on the east
coast, branching at the attractive little
village of Mount Stewart. Following the
northern branch, Tracadie is reached. It is on the north shore,
where bathing is most enjoyed on the numerous sandy beaches.
Here are marshes and ponds where springs rise out of the ground,
and where wild fowl make their homes in the reeds and long grass;
often shut in by wooded banks, and only separated from the sea by
sand dunes with wreckage and projecting drift. Everything is
fresh, bright and clean; and such scenes, so difficult to describe,
must be seen to understand the impression they make on the mind.</p>

<p class="caption">On the Morell River</p>
</div>
<p>The Morell River is a delightful spot for camping grounds.
There are cold springs of pure water everywhere, the banks are
wooded and pleasantly varied, it has numerous trout pools, and
there is a clear run up the winding river for a number of miles. Canoes
may ascend six or seven miles, at least. The river flows into St.
Peter&rsquo;s Bay. Along the banks of the lakes and rivers of the neighborhood,
and by the shore, the remains of many cellars are found
over which formerly stood the houses of the Acadian fishermen.</p>
<p>St. Peter&rsquo;s, as is fitting, stands on a hill&mdash;if not on a rock&mdash;and
has a good situation overlooking the head of the bay, with the
comfortable-looking little church crowning the top of the wooded
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
slope. The river from the east winds in and out, and the bay waters
make larger curves as they run to the sea. Cattle feed on the
meadow land bordering the stream. A very nice run for small
boats is here, as the water is land-locked for a mile or two. Larger
boats may find plenty of water nearer the sea. The train runs along
the whole shore. Numerous winches are seen in passing. They
are used for digging oyster shells from the deposits at the bottom
of the channel, the shells being ground for fertilizing purposes.</p>
<p>The little hamlet just passed is known as Five Houses. Only
four can be seen, but doubtless the other is there behind one of the
trees. There is a fine prospect of rolling country, and far in the
distance the white farmhouses may be seen dotting the slopes. At
times we stop at a pleasant little clearing in the wood. At such
places a sort of glorified summer house acts as station or shelter,
with shady paths leading off through the woodland. Following
these a mile or two, little settlements are found nestling against a
bank, or reposing by a mill pond; or maybe on the crest of a hill
that overlooks a dainty and peaceful valley, where a pellucid brook
flows rippling by as it sings gaily on the way to &ldquo;its bourne below
the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Oh, for a romp through that blissful land,</p>
<p class="t2">The Isle of the summer sea,</p>
<p class="t0">Where nature appears in her fairest dress,</p>
<p class="t0">Where the days are cool, and no heats oppress,</p>
<p class="t2">And the heart must dance with glee.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="img" id="pic_212">
<img src="images/p0227.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="502" />

<p>The headwaters of numerous small streams are passed in further
progress east, until at Harmony a
network of rivers is on every hand.
North Lake, at almost the extreme east
of the Island, on the north shore, is
reached from here. It is decidedly
picturesque, and would well reward
the artist in search of good subjects.
For camping it offers ideal sites at its
western end, where it receives the clear
little stream that flows through and
out into the sea. This is a choice spot
for trout; in fact one of the best.</p>

<div class="img" id="pic_213">
<img src="images/p0228.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="680" />
</div>
<p>Years ago, on one of the pretty
wooded knolls overlooking the shore at a
point distant from any settlement, a
summer camp was pitched. Three girls
of the party were one day taking a long
ramble along the coast, when they walked
unexpectedly into a group of armed men
so busily engaged, or so confident of
isolation, that they had forgotten to
station a look-out to warn them of anyone
approaching. They were smugglers,
but otherwise respectable; and, fortunately
for the girls, the days of freebooters
were past. The girls were immediately
surrounded, and an angry discussion ensued between the men who
numbered some eighteen or twenty. The smugglers had been
caught in the midst of their work, and they were not nearly ready
to leave. Hence it was proposed to hold the girls captive for the
next day or two, to prevent an alarm being given. The girls were,
of course, greatly distressed, and the incident threatened to cause
grave trouble.</p>
<p>Finally one of the girls, who had assumed the leadership
of her party in the controversy, spoke out and frightened the
leader by telling him they were three of a large party, the remainder
of which would soon come and look for them. As a matter
of fact the party only numbered seven, all told, of whom five were
women. In addition the girl volunteered, and so did her companions,
to preserve strict secrecy about the matter if they should be allowed
to leave. A consultation was again held, as a result of which,
after exacting the strictest secrecy under pain of future penalty,
the girls were allowed to depart, the name and address of the
spokeswoman being taken, however, in precaution.</p>
<p>The girls left, and returned to the camp. For two days
their companions could not understand the feverish anxiety with
which they watched two schooners that were hovering about some
miles off shore. At last the vessels departed. The girls kept their
secret well, and the incident gradually passed out of active memory.</p>
<p>One day, however, a package was mysteriously left at the
door of that one of the girls who had assumed leadership in the
negotiations with the smugglers. It was found by the young lady
herself. It contained material for a handsome silk dress, and, in
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
addition a roll of finest French lace. On an enclosed card was
marked the single word, &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; The package had been laid at
the door, and there was no way of returning it; so what was to be
done?</p>
<p>It is said that women &ldquo;wink&rdquo; at smuggling, sometimes, in
order to add to their fascination by the addition of sundry little
pieces of <i>lingerie</i>; and so please the men. Be this as it may, it is
recorded that a certain young lady soon appeared in gorgeous raiment,
in which real French lace played no unimportant part; and it is also
recorded, though hard to believe, that one woman had been found
who could keep a secret, for not even the other two of the trio ever
learned the origin of the handsome gown.</p>
<p>An extract relating to camping life will be of interest to all
who enjoy that method of &ldquo;living close to nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are ladies to spend the day! Let us meet them at
the station. This is the carriage&mdash;a hay wagon, with boards across
for seats. In we pile. Crack goes the whip, and we are off, a merry
party enough as we hold on to one another for dear life, to keep from
being jolted out. &lsquo;Oh! what a bump!&rsquo; But what matters a bump
when the heart is light; and we wake the echoes with song and glee.</p>
<p>We are all starving when we reach camp, and culinary operations
are soon in full swing.</p>
<p>All shortcomings are overlooked or made light of. If anyone
puts salt in his tea, or drinks vinegar for lime-juice, the mistake
increases the fun; but when the coffee won&rsquo;t pour, and an investigation
discloses a chicken inside, the climax is reached. After that
all are sober&mdash;because they cannot laugh any more&mdash;and lie around
in picturesque confusion, enjoying a shady rest in the heat of the
day. Some swing in hammocks, novel in hand, but perhaps not in
thought, for the novelty of the situation exceeds that of the story.
Some have a quiet game of cards&mdash;a log for table. The lazy man
sleeps the sleep of peace, till wakened by the cry of Kitty, the energetic
member of the party, who exclaims &lsquo;Oh, dear! I did not come
here to sleep! I&rsquo;m off to explore. If only I were on the opposite
side,&rsquo; with a longing glance across the water. Cousin Will gallantly
comes to her assistance; and taking her up like a feather, is
soon in mid-stream. &lsquo;Quick! snap them!&rsquo; cries Florence, &lsquo;and we
will send the picture to Will&rsquo;s best girl&rsquo;; while plump Fanny, with
her 150 pounds avoirdupois, looks longingly on.</p>
<p>At evening we drink a cup of tea and look to our fishing gear.
Flies, rods, and baskets are put in order. All clothing of any value
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
is discarded. Top boots pulled on, pipes filled, and we wend our
way up or down stream, to some favorite pool. Everything is quiet
but the swish of the lines. The fish are lively but small; and just as
we are tiring of that kind of sport our hearts are gladdened to see,
peering through a cloud, the bright full moon. Her silver light
replaces the fading after-glow of the sunset. The small fish suddenly
pause and disappear as if they had gone to their bed; and
silence reigns in the forest.</p>

</div>
<p>Now we know that the real fun will begin, if there is to be
any. Sure enough, before long, and without the slightest warning,
a quick splash breaks the water, and the click, click, of Tom&rsquo;s reel
announces the hooking of the first three-pounder. The sportsman&rsquo;s
heart beats high, as with practiced eye and
feeling hand he follows the wild rushes of
the speckled beauty, and finally, with
doubled rod plays him into the shallows,
where he is secured. And now the sport
waxes warm. The water is beaten with
foam as we fight with the struggling leviathans,
and the enthusiastic Harry rushes in
to the neck, net in hand, to capture a fish
that pulls like a whale. We take our way
back to camp with light hearts and heavy
baskets. The ladies apostrophize the moon
and the beauty of the night; but sentiment
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
gives way to cake and coffee. Soon we start for the railroad station.
Various and comical are the adventures of the shady roads, though,
finally, we catch the train, and bid adieu to our tired but happy
visitors. Such were our days in camp&mdash;oases in the desert of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">Souris, Prince Edward Island</p>
</div>
<p>The town of Souris is on Colville Bay at the eastern end of
the Island. As would be expected from its remote situation, it is
quiet and peaceful, and, like most of the Island resorts, it offers
attractions only to those who enjoy living in isolated places. Such
places always have a character or individuality of their own not
found in or near crowded centres. They also offer the great advantage
of inexpensive living. Steamers leave from here for Pictou, N. S., and
also for the Magdalen Islands. These islands are populated by Acadian
fishermen, and are visited by many on account of the quaint old-world
life that may be seen there. A very large fishing industry is
carried on from the Magdalen Islands, and many American and
Canadian vessels frequent those waters. Lobstering and sealing are
carried on there in the proper seasons, and sea birds are found in
remote parts in enormous number.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_217">
<img src="images/p0232.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="392" />
</div>
<p>Souris itself is an old Acadian village.
It has a pleasant strip of sand
beach, and enjoyable summer days are
spent by those who seek the quiet hospitality
of the cool little place.</p>
<p>Going east from Mount Stewart
Junction on the southern loop of the
eastern division of the Prince Edward
Island Railway, the Cardigan River is
reached. This empties into Cardigan Bay to the north of the
promontory on which stands Georgetown, a small seaport and
summer resort. Passing Brudenell, Georgetown, by the Junction
of the Brudenell and Montague Rivers, is reached. A very pleasing
picture is presented by the flocks of sheep and young, sportive lambs
feeding in the fields just recently harvested, together with the smiling
&ldquo;stooks&rdquo; of grain, and the never-failing dark green belt of trees for
a background.</p>
<p>After Charlottetown, Summerside, and the district bounded
by Bradalbane, New London, Rustico and Hunter River, there is
no doubt that the Georgetown-Montague River district comes next
in importance. Indeed, the first two centres are named in that
order chiefly because they are populous, with some life, and on
that account have superior attractions for the average summer
visitor. The quadrangle bounded by the four next named points
takes its place because the scenery is good, and the district quite accessible.
But for beauty of scene the more remote Georgetown-Montague
River district is surely second to none, and without fear
of contradiction it may be termed picturesque and charming. The
six-mile run from Montague Junction to Montague through beautiful
woodlands, with occasional prospect of hill, valley and stream, is
most enjoyable; and lovely Montague, and quaint Georgetown with
its wide, quiet, and pleasant streets and modest little shore bungalows,
are both places that should be seen by all.</p>
<p>Georgetown carries on a small shipping trade, and fishing is
an industry. Anyone that loves a quiet and old-fashioned place,
with grassy streets and tranquil shore, will be sure to be at home in
the pleasant little resort. Steamers leave from here for Lower
Montague, Charlottetown, Pictou and the Magdalen Islands. There
are ample opportunities for boating and canoeing on the harbor
and outflowing rivers.</p>

<p>From Charlottetown another
easterly division of the Prince Edward
Island Railway, the most southerly
of all, runs to Murray River and
Murray Harbor. Dipping south, and
in the main following the contour of
the coast a few miles in, it has its
terminus at the most southerly harbor
on the east coast.</p>
<p>The scenery along this route
is quite interesting, and there are a
number of Scottish villages of small
size along the way. Murray Harbor is another little stopping place
where there is a very homelike hotel at which to sojourn. There is
boating and driving, and, of course, sea-fishing. Like Alberton and
Tignish, etc., it is one of the quietest places that can be found
anywhere; and as there is good air, very pleasant days may be spent
with its hospitable people.</p>
<p>Lawrence W. Watson&rsquo;s description of a summer scene is well
adapted to give a glimpse of Island life for those who are nature-lovers.
&ldquo;Some love the open countryside where golden-rods wave
their orange plumes, and blue and white asters bestar the field
borders. Others like the wet swamp with its tangle of grasses and
sedges and succulent plants delighting in moisture. Some love the
brookside fringed with the white-flowered spikes of the snake-head,
and the light graceful sprays of the balsam dangling its golden jewels
by the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Others delight in the flats near the seashore where the prickly
saltwort roots, and silverweed spreads its finely cut, pinnate leaves
with their backing of silver, and above, on the banks, where the
Kingfisher nests, the pale yellow evening primrose mingles its blossoms
with those of the oxeye daisy, and of its sister, the mayweed with
its finely dissected leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a more delectable retreat than any of these is the cool
grateful shade of the shadowy woodland, where the sun enters but
shyly to brighten and nourish, while the verdure may languish in
the open beyond. Here are the pearly-pink bells of the pyrolas,
and the one-flowered pyrola&mdash;that exquisitely scented, firm, waxen
flower. Here the Clintonia spreads out its three smooth leaves,&mdash;handsome,
spotless, myrtle-hued beauties&mdash;and later replaces its yellow-green
lily-cups with berries challenging the blue of the heavens.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, too, the &lsquo;wake-robin&rsquo;&mdash;the shy, painted trillium&mdash;opens
its three tender dark-pencilled petals, resting in strong relief against
the background of its whorl of three leaves. Nearby the tenderest
flower of the woodland&mdash;the delicate white, purple-veined, lonely
flowered wood sorrel. Here, too, are orchids, and here we find the
strange Indian-pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above us the cool waving canopy of foliage, around us the
stately columns of tree trunks, mosses and leaves thick-strewn pave
the pathway, fair forms of flowers enriching the carpet. Thus nature
patterns her spacious cathedral with pillars and arches, groined roof
and rich carving: the soft, balmy breezes breathe exquisite music
and waft towards heaven the flowers&rsquo; devotion&mdash;a subtle, sweet
incense, grateful, refreshing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those from southern climes who seek these shores for cool
summer joys will be interested in a brief account of the Ice Boat
Service between Prince Edward Island and the mainland in the
depth of winter. &ldquo;During about two months in mid-winter the
crossing of the ice-crushing steamers is supplemented by a service
of ice-boats. These boats have double keels which serve for runners,
and sometimes the ice-fields are packed in solidly between the two
shores, enabling the boats to cross on the ice without putting them
into the water at all. Four leathern straps are attached to each side
of a boat for pulling it over the ice; and, of course, the boats are strong
and adapted to float the ice-strewn wave when nearly open water
has to be crossed. Rough or hummocky ice renders the crossing very
laborious and difficult, but frequently lanes of open water enable
the crews to row. Should snow storms arise there is danger of losing
the bearings, and travelling far out of the course. Compasses, provisions,
fur wraps, etc., are part of the regular equipment of this
ice-boat service. For a distance of about one mile on each side of the
Strait, the ice is attached solidly to the shore and is known as the
&lsquo;board ice.&rsquo; The crossing is made between Capes Tormentine and
Traverse, where the Strait is only nine miles wide. This leaves only
seven miles for the ice-boat ferry, but owing to the tide, which runs
about four miles an hour, carrying with it the ice fields, the distance
travelled by the boats is considerably increased. Teams carry the
passengers from the edge of the board ice to the railway stations.
A trip by the capes in winter is certainly an unique experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, it should be stated that the people of the Island, like
the climate, are pleasant and genial; and a stay in the &ldquo;Garden of
the Gulf&rdquo; is sure to bring the double reward of health and pleasure.</p>

<p>Going from Moncton, and turning east
at Painsec Junction, the main line of
the Intercolonial Railway to Truro and
Halifax may now be followed. The line
soon dips south and crosses the peninsula
that juts out into Chignecto Bay. Dorchester
and Sackville are thus reached, and
then the boundary line is passed that marks
an entrance into the province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The first district thus traversed is that of the Memramcook
Valley, with its interesting Acadian villages. The scenery of the almost
level valley and its high wooded ridges is very pleasant. Dorchester,
with its excellent farming land, has water communication with and
is almost on the Chignecto Bay. Sackville is a growing and prosperous
place at the mouth of the Tantramar River. It is widely known for
the excellent educational advantages it provides for the acquirement
of many branches of learning, by both sexes. The University of
Mount Allison College grants degrees in Divinity and Arts, and
has honor courses in Classics, Mathematics, Science, Philosophy
and English Language and Literature. In the study of Law it
has an affiliation with the Dalhousie Law School. The Academy
and Commercial College is well equipped for good work, and the
Ladies&rsquo; College has a splendid music department (Conservatory of
Music) with every facility for thorough study, including a fine
three-manual pipe organ. The Owens&rsquo; Museum of Fine Arts,
in connection with the Owens&rsquo; Art Institution, has a notable
collection of over four hundred works of art. All of these
institutions have an excellent reputation, and they enjoy a
liberal patronage from all over the provinces. The Tantramar
River also empties into Chignecto Bay. The Tantramar marshes
are widely known for their enormous crops of excellent hay. Heavy
shipments are made of fine cattle that have been raised in this
district.</p>

</div>
<p>A short railway line runs from Sackville to Cape Tormentine.</p>
<p>In winter the Northumberland Strait is frozen in heavy ice,
through which the regular summer steamships cannot force their way.
Special ice-breaking steamers are therefore placed on the most open
route between Pictou and Charlottetown or Georgetown; but the ice
is occasionally so thick that even these powerful vessels are unable
to force their way across the frozen strait. At such times the short
crossing from Cape Tormentine to Cape Traverse is used, and the
mail is carried in ice-boats with double keels made to act as &ldquo;runners.&rdquo;
These are pushed by hand over the ice, and put into open water as
required. An account of a trip in this novel kind of &ldquo;ferry&rdquo; forms
part of the description under the heading &ldquo;Prince Edward Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Missiguash River being now passed, and the province of
Nova Scotia entered, a brief description of the main features of the
seaboard province is here given.</p>
<p>The peninsula of Nova Scotia is so nearly surrounded by water
that it is frequently termed an island. It is connected to New Brunswick
and the mainland by a comparatively narrow isthmus at the head
of Chignecto Bay. The province of Nova Scotia is made up of
this peninsula and the adjoining island of Cape Breton to the northeast,
separated only by the Strait of Canso, which is not much
more than a mile in width at its narrowest part.</p>
<p>As has already been stated, the four provinces of Quebec,
New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia offer
wonderful contrasts in scenery and natural configuration. They also
offer a pleasing variety of climate. As would be expected, it is cooler
the nearer the approach to the open Atlantic shore; and it is cooler
again the farther east and north one proceeds along the Atlantic
seaboard. From this it will be understood that on the north, or
Bay of Fundy and Northumberland Strait shore, it is warmer than
on the south or open Atlantic side. On the north the climate approximates
closely to that of the Lower St. Lawrence and southern part
of New Brunswick. The south shore, then, is the coolest part of the
Maritime Provinces, and on the south shore itself an increasingly
lower temperature may be enjoyed as progress is made up the coast
in an easterly direction. It is important to remember this, for out
<span class="pb" id="Page_231">231</span>
of the variety thus provided it is possible
to choose a climate suited to
almost every need. In the chapter
&ldquo;Where to go&mdash;Recommended
Places,&rdquo; these features are clearly
explained.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_223">
<img src="images/p0239.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="413" />
</div>
<p>The peninsular part of Nova
Scotia is not nearly so mountainous
as the sister provinces of Quebec and
New Brunswick, although it is much
more so than Prince Edward Island; but the island part of Nova
Scotia, Cape Breton, has ample variety of mountain and vale, and
has in many parts of it all the bold features found in rugged
and mountainous countries. The peninsula is not without its own
mountains and chains of hills; but its bold and striking scenery is
found chiefly on the Atlantic coast side, the rocky bays and headlands
of which receive the full force of the fierce winter gales.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia has a coast line of over one thousand miles, and
it is rich in bays, inlets and fine harbors. Its rivers, though numerous,
are not large. No great system of intercommunicating waterways is
found in the province, but the peninsula is so well watered by lake,
river, and stream that fully one fifth of its area is thus occupied.
In Cape Breton, for instance, the inland sea known as the Bras
d&rsquo;Or Lake is about fifty miles long. It fully answers the purposes
of great intercommunicating waterways, for this enclosed sea has an
interior reach over a very large extent of country. Peninsular Nova
Scotia has numerous lakes, mostly of moderate and small dimensions,
although Rossignol Lake and a few others are quite large.</p>
<p>The province is bountifully blessed with many beautiful bays.
The easterly extension of the Bay of Fundy, known as Minas Basin,
reaches inland some sixty miles; and here the equinoctial tides have been
known to show the wonderful difference in level of forty to fifty feet.</p>
<p>The Maritime Provinces are bound together by the strongest
ties. Each province has its own advantages peculiar to its situation
and natural resources. In many cases what one has the other has
not; and climate and beauty of scene will be found in such delightful
contrast in passing from one province to the other that few not
acquainted with these facts could believe.</p>
<p>It is now matter of general knowledge that the early settlement
of Nova Scotia was made by the French. De Monts and Champlain
explored parts of the south shore, entered the Annapolis Basin,
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
made choice of a site there for settlement, and explored
the Minas Basin. Later they founded Port Royal, in
the year 1605, but abandoned it a few years after.
Some Scottish settlers endeavored to open up the
country. They made little progress, and it was the
French who increased most in numbers. Then came
the Acadian Expulsion, followed by a more rapid
general settlement; for by this time Halifax had been
founded, German colonists began to arrive, and, in
later years, disbanded British regiments and United Empire Loyalists
commenced to swell the population. In the meantime the province
as part of Acadia, and later as Nova Scotia, had several times been
owned in turn by the French and English; but finally after the taking
of Quebec by Wolfe, and after the close of the American Revolutionary
War, a lasting peace ensued, and Nova Scotia, as part of Canada and
the British Empire, has prospered. Other details of history that are
of sufficient importance are brought out in connection with the
descriptions of localities.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_224">
<img src="images/p0240.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="473" />
</div>
<p>Resuming the description of the country traversed by, and
that tributary to, the Intercolonial Railway, at the boundary line
of the two provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, the railway,
immediately after crossing the line, reaches Amherst, not far
from Cumberland Basin.</p>
<p>The bright and prosperous town of Amherst is a pleasant
centre for a number of other interesting places. To the north is
Tidnish on the Northumberland Straits, a little watering place where
good boating and deep-sea fishing may be enjoyed. Stages run N.E.
to Head of Amherst, and there are other places, remote from the railroad,
that are quite interesting.</p>
<p>The works of the Chignecto Marine Transport Railway are
within easy reach by carriage. This abandoned project was intended
to lift ships of a thousand tons, place them on huge ship-carriages
by means of hydraulic power, and then haul them by locomotives
to the terminus on the Northumberland Straits near Tidnish, where
they were again to be put in the water and so save the great distance
a vessel must now go to reach the St. Lawrence from the Bay of
Fundy.</p>
<p>A few miles north-west of Amherst are the ruins of Fort
Cumberland beyond the Aulac River. On this site formerly stood
the French fort of Beausejour. It was from Fort St. Lawrence, also
in the immediate neighborhood, that the attack was made on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
French fort that resulted in its capture. In
revolutionary times the Americans attacked
Fort Cumberland after it had passed into
the possession of the British. The attack
failed, and the Colonials were compelled to
give up and retire on the St. John River.
The view of Fort Cumberland is still an interesting
one, and many Acadian relics have
been found in the vicinity. The view from
the bastions of the old fort is superb and far-reaching.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_225">
<img src="images/p0241.jpg" alt="" width="346" height="500" />
</div>
<p>At Maccan Station coaches may be taken to Minudie and
Joggins. It will come as a surprise to many when they learn that
the &ldquo;Elysian Fields&rdquo; are near here. But such is the case, for that is
the name of the rich meadows near Minudie on the Chignecto
Peninsula. The Joggins Shore is not far from Minudie. It received
its odd name from the remarkable configuration of the cliffs which
&ldquo;jog in&rdquo; and out so wonderfully that many have been attracted here
to study the phenomenon. The cliffs are strikingly bold, often
approaching four hundred feet in height. Fine views may also be
seen by taking the long drive to Apple River. Advocate Harbor is
another quaint and distant place, well worth a visit. Good fishing
is found on the upper waters of the Apple River which reach out to
Caribou Plains.</p>
<p>At Springhill Junction a short railroad leads west and south
to Parrsboro on the north shore of the Minas Basin. Here will be
found a pleasant little summer resort where boating and fishing may
be enjoyed, with good hunting in season. Fine views are obtained
from Partridge Island in front of the harbor. There are also good
roads and pleasant drives to places nearby. Moose River and Five
Islands to the east may be reached in this way, as well as Advocate
Harbor and Cap d&rsquo;Or on the west. Massive Cape Blomidon, the
end of the North Mountain chain, is only eight miles distant on the
projection that makes out from the opposite or southern shore of
Minas, and excellent views of it may be had from the steamboat
running between Parrsboro&rsquo; and Kingsport.</p>
<p>At River Philip and Oxford Junction, on the Intercolonial
Railway, a very pretty country is found, and both for fishing and
country rambles the district is an excellent one.</p>
<p>The country between Westchester and Folleigh Lake is remarkably
beautiful, and this, the Wentworth Valley, is one of the garden
spots of Canada. Many pretty views
are had from the train as it climbs the
Cobequid Mountains which here run from
east to west.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>

<div class="img" id="pic_227">
<img src="images/p0243.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="391" />
</div>
<p>A drive or, better still, a walk
through the valley will bring a hundred
pleasures to those who love nature and
the beautiful. Here is the winding
Wallace River, and here, too, are fifty tiny streams, waterfalls and
brooks. Some are dashing headlong and sparkling in the sun; others,
with white foam shaded to a cream by the overhanging trees, have
inner depths that the eye cannot fathom until accustomed to the
narrow limits of light and shade.</p>
<p>The air is musical with falling and rippling water, so here let
us take a seat by the side of this merry cascade and listen to
Nature&rsquo;s harmonies. So various are the notes, each waterfall having
its own, it is not difficult to select sounds that make melodies. But
whatever the melody, the dominant harmony is that of joy and gladness,
and as the eye views mountain, valley, woodland, river,
waterfall and plashing brook, surely no fairer scene could well be
imagined.</p>
<p>And listen to the birds as they add their merry roundelay.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Break out and sing, ye happy birds!</p>
<p class="t0">Your tender music needs no words</p>
<p class="t">To tell us everything.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But the green shade of the woodland is inviting, and following
the gayest and most dashing of little streams that ever ran from mountain
side to woodland depths, we trace a path by the wild flowers,
and pass in, deeper and deeper. Right at the threshold is the daisy.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">&ldquo;No shame feels she, though in lowly place,</p>
<p class="t0">No envy of rivals gorgeously clad,</p>
<p class="t">Contentment gleams from her pure, fresh face,</p>
<p class="t0">And her glance can gladden a heart that&rsquo;s sad</p>
<p class="t">By its radiant grace.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But deeper in we go. What splendid solitude. How quickly
every fibre responds to the thrilling call of nature. The faintly
rustling leaves, the plash of the brook, now subdued to becoming
solemnity, the distant silvery note of the bird at the edge of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
forest, the shade and restful monotone
of the filtered light, the delightful
air, the unbroken calm, and
above all the mysterious note of
life and creation that emanates
from the very ground&mdash;all these
compel thought and enjoyment of
the kind that ever leaves an ineffaceable
imprint on the memory.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_228">
<img src="images/p0244.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="355" />
</div>
<p>What noble trees! Here is
one that throws lofty arms far out, and covers with a fresh green
roof a space that is rich in violets and many of the humbler flowers.
And see! in sheltered spot, far in and screened from the mellow
light, this tiny orchid beneath the shelter of her giant brother:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t5">&ldquo;Nestled at his root</p>
<p class="t0">Is beauty, such as blooms not in the glare</p>
<p class="t0">Of the broad sun.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But now in company with our little woodland stream we
pass out into the more open valley. As we do so a sound as of a
swelling echo from the mountain range to the left falls on the ear,
like unto the great forest murmur of the bending pines when under
the influence of a strong upland breeze. It increases more and
more, until suddenly it is apparent that the sound comes from the
twin-mountain chain to the right. Looking up, and following
the wave of sound with straining eyes, we search for the cause, without
perceiving it. Far up we gaze, where the trees and the fleecy
white clouds are outlined against the deep blue of the sky; and then
we realize that an Intercolonial train has passed high up in the air,
somewhere between sky and valley, but entirely concealed by the
dense forest growth&mdash;so much so that not even a trace of smoke or
vapor can be seen, so effectually have they been filtered and dissipated
by the thick woodland screen.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Oh! tenderly deepen the woodland glooms,</p>
<p class="t2">And merrily sway the beeches;</p>
<p class="t0">Breathe delicately the willow blooms,</p>
<p class="t2">And the pines rehearse new speeches;</p>
<p class="t0">The elms toss high till they reach the sky,</p>
<p class="t2">Pale catkins the yellow birch launches,</p>
<p class="t0">But the tree I love all the greenwood above</p>
<p class="t2">Is the maple of sunny branches.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">Bungalow, Folleigh Lake</p>
</div>
<p>Climbing the hills to reach the level of Folleigh Lake brings
a reward in the form of a gorgeous sunset; and if sunset is entrancing
in this quiet spot, what may be said of a row over the lake in the
early morning in time to see the golden sunrise of a bright August
day. There is calm for the minds of those who stay here in bungalow
or cottage along the margin of the lake, and the pleasant vista
of wooded banks and beautiful sheet of water in front lays immediate
siege to the heart. How everything sparkles in this beautiful
mountain, and how delightfully fresh and green are all the surroundings.
It is one of the few places where railway station and
water tank strike no discordant note in the general scene, so strong
is it in simple beauty. The long bright lines of rail that plunge
abruptly into the forest and disappear so mysteriously&mdash;leaving no
trace of their whereabouts&mdash;look like lines of beauty; and they
soothe by their presence, for we know that in good season we can
regain the outer world when the all-too-brief vacation has been spent.</p>

<p class="caption">Truro Park&mdash;A Romantic Spot</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>But mountain days are over for the present, and so leaving
the lake behind, and with it the invigorating air of the heights, we
gradually pass through Londonderry,
over the Folleigh River and
into Truro, obtaining many pleasant
glimpses of Cobequid Bay
along the route thus taken.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_231">
<img src="images/p0247.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="337" />
</div>
<p>Although Truro is a prosperous
manufacturing town, and an
important Intercolonial centre as
well, it is yet one of the prettiest
and most homelike places in Nova Scotia. A pleasant river runs
nearby, and it is surrounded by graceful and well-wooded hills. The
streets are well laid out and have abundance of shade; and the public
buildings, the stores, and the general appearance of the smart town
make a strong impression from the first. It is within a mile or two
of Cobequid Bay, and the farming land round about is excellent.</p>
<p>Acadian French once lived here, but the real settlement of
Truro dates from a few years after the &ldquo;Expulsion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truro is a very pleasant inland town in which to spend a
vacation. There is beautiful and romantic country on every hand,
with excellent roads. The fishing round about is fair; the hunting,
in season, excellent. There are many interesting places within easy
reach, both by road and rail; and the town offers a pleasant social
life that is very enjoyable for those who like to summer in a country
town where comfort and some variety in life may be had.</p>
<p>On the meadow-lands traces have been found of the dykes
thrown up by the Acadians. Willows planted by them have survived
to this day.</p>
<p>The joy and pride of Truro is her beautiful pleasure ground,
usually called Victoria Park; but just as often termed the Joe Howe
Park, from the fact that it contains the Howe Falls, named after
him, and also because it is proposed to erect a Howe memorial there
later on. The park has been described as &ldquo;Nature&rsquo;s fairyland, . . . .
with its groves, its deep ravines and its beautiful waterfall.&rdquo; This
is about as good a brief description as could be made. The park is
so beautiful that merely to describe it as one of the best in the province
is to rob it of its just due. It has really all the characteristics
of a great park, deserves to be classed with the chief pleasure grounds
of Canada, and is, in fact, superior in natural beauty to any of the
well-known North American parks. It is surely only a question of
time before excursion trains will bring people from all over to enjoy
the delights of this picturesque place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_232">
<img src="images/p0248.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="500" />
</div>
<p>The entrance to Victoria park is
at the front door of the town, for it is
close to the Intercolonial Railway Station.
Scarcely anything has been done here to
alter the approach or surroundings. It has
been left almost as found, and the result is
very satisfactory. The deep ravine that
runs through the park, and contributes so
much to its romantic aspect, has its opening
at the place selected for an entrance, and
a pretty little stream winds its way in the
channel thus provided. A carriage drive penetrates
for some distance, but the strong feature
that pleases all who visit here is the multitude of walks and romantic
by-paths that lead off in every direction.</p>
<p>Here are innumerable little dells with banks of brightest
green; and under shady birches or maples are comfortable seats
for three or four people&mdash;generally holding two, however&mdash;where
with a pleasant book, or dainty fancy work, many enjoyable hours
may be spent in delightful company with birds and flowers. Yonder
is a rocky bluff, tipped with green, and down its face trickles a
little rill, wetting the projecting edges of the rock and causing them
to glisten like silver. Just opposite are even bolder heights that are
clothed in a wealth of woodland growth reaching up to the very top.</p>
<p>Here the park brook turns off into more secluded ways, and
following it, instead of the road, a charming sylvan dale is found
where not one sound intrudes save the music of the birds and the
gentle ripple of the water&mdash;surely a fit retreat for artist, poet or
dreamer. Here where &ldquo;nature reigns&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Within its banks this little stream includes</p>
<p class="t0">A world remote from all the world of men;</p>
<p class="t0">And hides a kingdom far from mortal ken,</p>
<p class="t0">In the green depths, where never foot intrudes.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Would you stand by the &ldquo;Wishing Well,&rdquo; and give expression
to your fondest day-dreams? The well is here, up a gentle slope
where all is tranquil and secluded. Would you climb &ldquo;Jacob&rsquo;s
Ladder&rdquo;&mdash;steps up to heaven&mdash;and land with your head in yon
fleecy cloud? Here are the rustic steps reaching to the top of the
height. Would you visit the &ldquo;Holy Well,&rdquo; where Acadian infants
<span class="pb" id="Page_241">241</span>
were christened in the long ago? Bible Hill is a little distant, so
here in the park is a &ldquo;Holy Well&rdquo; from which, by no stretch of imagination,
the same water flows.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are anxious to keep your youth, and to stave off
the days of grey hairs, wrinkles and rheumatism? Pray sit in the
&ldquo;Rejuvenating Seat&rdquo; by the Joe Howe Falls, and if you do not grow
younger as you watch the lovely sight&mdash;nothing else can stay the

<p>Then possibly you wish to test your self-control by peering
over the brink of the &ldquo;Sheer-Drop&rdquo; without shuddering; or you
would entrench yourself on the heights of &ldquo;Spion-Kop,&rdquo; ask important
questions of the &ldquo;Sphinx,&rdquo; from the bridge nearby, walk along
the &ldquo;Observation Gallery,&rdquo; or pass to the lower depths by &ldquo;Muir&rsquo;s
Descent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In your walks about, the beauty of everything has taken
complete possession of you. The noble trees spreading a magnificent
canopy over your head bring to mind the words of Bryant,
for here nature has &ldquo;hewn the shaft, laid the architrave and spread
the roof above.&rdquo; In such a cathedral the mind soars upward:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t11">&ldquo;Ah, why</p>
<p class="t0">Should we, in the world&rsquo;s riper years, neglect</p>
<p class="t0">God&rsquo;s ancient sanctuaries, and adore</p>
<p class="t0">Only among the crowd, and under roofs</p>
<p class="t0">That our frail hands have raised?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But here comes a maiden on her way to the &ldquo;Nymph&rsquo;s Grotto.&rdquo;
She is too young, and floats along too buoyantly, to have come by
way of the rustic &ldquo;Bridge of Sighs.&rdquo; Barely eighteen, she cannot
have interrupted her tripping course to rest in the &ldquo;Widow&rsquo;s Proposal
Seat&rdquo;; but in all probability she has stopped at the &ldquo;Lily Cauldron&rdquo;
to admire the virgin bloom:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The white water-lilies, they sleep on the lake,</p>
<p class="t0">Till over the mountain the sun bids them wake.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">At the rose-tinted touch of the long, level ray,</p>
<p class="t0">Each pure, perfect blossom unfolds to the day.</p>

<p>As the Truro vision in white, with happy lace and the light
exulting step of early youth, passes by, it is evident she will never
need to sit in the &ldquo;Leap Year Engagement Seat,&rdquo; where &ldquo;no man
may say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to a self-respecting, modest woman.&rdquo; Let us hope
that the heart of the male to whom the leap-year question is here
&ldquo;popped&rdquo; will not be affected by the &ldquo;Cold Chamber&rdquo; nearby.
And see, our pretty maiden does not stop and rest in the &ldquo;Irresistible
Engagement Seat&rdquo;; for is she not
irresistibly engaging herself, without
art or other allurement.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_235">
<img src="images/p0251b.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="335" />
</div>
<p>And now by a happy inspiration
we guess her name. She is
&ldquo;Phyllis,&rdquo; of course, and she is on
her way to her own seat high up and
tree-embowered, where her lover has
long and impatiently waited her coming,
as all true-lovers ever have done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thou art a fool, said my head to my heart,</p>

<p class="t2">Thou art worse than a fool, O head!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In the park will be found a spacious, amphitheatre-like picnic
dell with tables and conveniences for those who must indulge in the
prosaic occupation of eating. It is a delightful spot, and too much
cannot be said in its praise.</p>
<p>And finally, far in the woodland depths, where a fine tree
has fallen across the ravine, there will be found a choice spot known
only to the favored few at present, but which will be sought out by
increasing numbers as it becomes known. It is called &ldquo;Toll-Bridge,&rdquo;
and here, unobserved of prying eyes, the happy lover has the right
to exact &ldquo;toll&rdquo; from his <i>inamorata</i>, or sweetheart, for assisting her
over. Not a single maiden has been known to cross &ldquo;unassisted,&rdquo;
and none may successfully resist the payment of toll in true-lover&rsquo;s
coin.</p>
<p>In proceeding from Truro to Halifax, the train passes not far
from the pleasant little village of Stewiacke. It then meets the
Shubenacadie River and stops at the busy little village of that name.
From this centre many places east of Halifax may conveniently be
reached by stage. Maitland, Gay&rsquo;s River, Upper and Middle
Musquodoboit, and even Guysboro and eastern shore points may all
be reached in this manner. Passing by the shore of Grand Lake,
stopping at Windsor Junction&mdash;from which place the picturesque
village of Waverley may be reached, as well as Annapolis Valley
and north-shore points&mdash;and proceeding along the shore of the
beautiful Bedford Basin, the city of Halifax soon comes into view,
and the outer Atlantic shore has been reached.</p>

<p>With a splendid situation on the slopes of a
great harbor, Halifax invites within her hospitable
gates all who would sojourn for a while
on the shore of the breezy Atlantic. Here is
surely a world-harbor, with magnificent approaches,
where fleets from every country may
ride in security, and here, more than in any
port of Canada, the marine of every nation,
and the giant warship, too, may be seen. As
many as fourteen men-of-war, or battleships,
have anchored here at one time, and the
Atlantic liners, the traders, the coasting steamers, the sailing vessels
and the multitude of sloops, fishing-smacks, yawls, sail boats, launches
and row boats all contribute to the general busy life of the port.
Its position on the eastern coast is supreme and cannot be challenged,
a position that indeed makes it an Empire port in every sense.
So much is this the case that with the assured growth of Canada,
Halifax must always keep pace; and at no very distant day a
harbor rivalling that of New York, a second Liverpool, will come
into being, and Halifax will be the seaport of a great British
Canadian Empire.</p>
<p>The city has been termed the Cronstadt of America, and it
well deserves the name, for its wharves and anchorages are at the
inner end of a great five-mile waterway, the banks and islands of
which provide commanding positions for the eventful day when
&ldquo;war&rsquo;s alarms&rdquo; shall make defense inevitable.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_238">
<img src="images/p0254b.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" />
</div>
<p>Active and stirring scenes
have been witnessed here during the
past century. Privateers, blockade-runners,
convoys or merchantmen,
and war vessels with prizes have
well covered the inner waters of
the harbor. Busy times those,
when in one day forty full-rigged
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
ships, brigs and schooners, with cargoes, were all sold at auction!
But better days have come, and peaceful commerce now prevails.</p>
<p>The Indian name for the water approach to Halifax was
Chebucto, the meaning of which is &ldquo;greatest of havens.&rdquo; The old
name was well given, for it is undoubtedly one of the world&rsquo;s great
harbors. The settlement received its present name about the middle
of the eighteenth century, in compliment to Lord Halifax, the sponsor
being Cornwallis.</p>
<p>The founding of Halifax was attended with great difficulties
owing to the hostility of the French and their Indian allies. The
original settlers came from England and the New England colonies,
as well as from Louisbourg when it was given up to the French by
treaty. At that time the woods ran to the water&rsquo;s edge, and every
foot of ground where now stands the city had to be carved out of the
forest. Boards and squared timber were brought from Boston to
build the first shelters.</p>
<p>Some twenty years after the settlement was showing signs
of a steady growth considerable excitement was caused by the arrival
of 600 Maroons who had been transported from Jamaica for participation
in a rebellion against the authorities of that island. They
caused much trouble, and showed a general unwillingness to work
or do anything useful. At first this did not show strongly, and work
was done by them on that part of the fortification known as the
Maroon Bastion. But later they became disaffected and troublesome.
One complained that he had to work his farm to get food. Another
objected because yams, bananas and cocoa would not grow in Nova
Scotia. A third was angry because there were no wild hogs to hunt.
Instead of being a help to the Colony, they were an encumbrance;
and troops had to be detailed to keep guard and prevent an outbreak.</p>
<p>Their life was altogether foreign to the country in which they
found themselves, and their customs could not be grafted on the
tree of Nova Scotian life. They became dissipated, and the only
work they would do was to hunt or fish. They were polygamous;
they buried their dead with unheard of rites in the hollows of the
rocks, provided rum, pipe, tobacco and two days&rsquo; rations, and thus
sent off the ghost of the departed for his journey to the undiscovered
land.</p>
<p>Fortunately at this time a place was found for them in Sierra
Leone in the land from which they had originated, and greatly to
the relief of Sir John Wentworth, the governor at that time, they
departed, accompanied by general rejoicings of all in Halifax.
Maroon Hall, their former headquarters,
has completely decayed;
but the great cellar may still be
seen by the waters of Cole Harbor
to the east of Halifax.</p>

<p>The city retains more
traces of its British origin than
any other place in America.
Just as Quebec is essentially
French, so is Halifax peculiarly
British; and to go from one of these places to the other, and
yet to realize that both are on the Western Continent, is to
experience many surprises. Canada is not old enough to have imposing
cities. To many this is cause for congratulation, for who
would care to go from New York to Halifax to see a second Gotham;
while visitors from Chicago, Philadelphia, Ontario, and Western
Canada find in old Halifax much that is absolutely new to them.
May these conditions continue for many years to come, for there is
nothing incompatible between progress and the preservation of all
old and well-tried things that fit in with and do not block the wheels
of the car in which we all travel, and that has marked above it the
direction &ldquo;Onward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Halifax is one of those restful and delightful places where
each day&rsquo;s recreation and exercise brings a night of peace and repose,
and where all the conveniences of modern life may be enjoyed without
the turmoil and din of the too-bustling city. And the country,
the woods, the lakes and the streams are all quite near; so that a life
half-city, half-country, may be lived without the inconvenience of
having to study traffic conditions at &ldquo;rush&rdquo; hours, etc.</p>
<p>In your rambles without the city you will come to a charming
little lake, with a fairy like boat resting tranquilly on its quiet
surface, where wild flowers spread a fragrant carpet around, and gay
little songbirds are in concert on the quivering birches. You will
stop to drink in the beauties of the delightful scene, and possibly
as you do so you will notice a young couple whose marriage, apparently,
is only a week or two in the past. Could there be a better
paradise, the world over, for bridal couples than the Maritime Provinces!
They are gazing with rapt attention at the scene, and you
believe they are talking. Are you curious to know what he is saying
and what she replies. Listen! he is speaking.</p>

</div>
<p>A conspicuous feature, visible from almost any part of the
city, is the Citadel. From its height a splendid and inspiring view
may be had of an immense stretch of country; while the harbor, the
coast and the surrounding waters are spread at the feet like a huge
map in relief. There is no better way of becoming acquainted with
the plan of the city and environs; for by walking around the ramparts
every outlying area may be seen reaching in to the streets
immediately below. By the Citadel gate may be seen two mortars
that were used at Louisbourg when that fortress surrendered to
Amherst and Wolfe. Visitors are admitted to the citadel on payment
of a small fee. The masonry work is enormously strong, and
the old-world appearance of glacis, moat and bastion suggest great
strength. It all typifies a fast-decaying system of fort defence, and
on that account, and because so picturesque, it is worthy of the
closest examination and interest. The one o&rsquo;clock gun still booms
from the upper rampart of the Citadel.</p>

<p>The modern fortifications for the defence of city and harbor
are on the islands, and along the shores that make out to the entrance.
On George&rsquo;s Island is Fort Charlotte, and opposite is Fort
Clarence. Forts Ogilvie, Cambridge and
Point Pleasant are in the park. Ives&rsquo; Point
and Fort MacNab are on MacNabs Island.
York Redoubt crowns a bluff on the western
side of the harbor, and Spion Kop is at
Sambro by the harbor entrance.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_242">
<img src="images/p0260.jpg" alt="" width="382" height="500" />
</div>
<p>The Dockyard is an interesting
place to visit, and the huge Dry Dock
should be seen when a great vessel is
within its gates.</p>
<p>A favorite recreation on summer
evenings is to row or drift in the harbor,
and listen to the music given by the bands of the flagships when
naval squadrons are in port.</p>
<p>The Provincial Parliament Building contains many interesting
historical portraits, and an excellent library that is
strong in provincial, Acadian and early history, etc. The long
oak table from the cabin of the <i>Beaufort</i> transport, around
which sat the council when Cornwallis took the oath as Governor
of Nova Scotia, is preserved in a room adjoining the Council
Chamber. In the grounds may be seen the South African Memorial
of the Nova Scotian soldiers who fell in the Boer War, and also the
Statue of the many-sided Joseph Howe.</p>
<p>A memorial to the soldiers who fell in the Crimean War is
erected near the gates of St. Paul&rsquo;s Old Churchyard; and not far
away is Government House, the residence of the Lieutenant-Governor
of the Province. City Hall stands in its own enclosure, and close
by is the quaint old clock tower erected by the Duke of Kent
near the foot of Citadel Hill. Punctual himself, he expected others to
be equally so. In a nearby building will be found a Natural History
Museum, open daily, and well worth seeing. St. Paul&rsquo;s Church still
includes as part of its structure much of the old portion erected soon
after the founding of Halifax. American visitors will be interested
in learning that the frame of the old building was imported from
Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Point Pleasant Park is one of the chief attractions for all who
visit the city. It is a park of great natural beauty, situated at the
outer end of the peninsula that includes Halifax. Here by the
rocky points, on the banks, or from seats under the trees, splendid
views of the harbor approaches may be obtained. Far out in the
offing is the open sea where white-sailed vessels from many parts
<span class="pb" id="Page_253">253</span>
are drawing nearer together
as they make the harbor. Sea
birds are circling and skimming
the waves in easy flight, and
the cool breeze blows landward,
bringing with it that
invigorating salty tang of old
ocean, every breath of which
seems like a draught from the
fabled &ldquo;Fountain of Youth.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Ocean liners, steamships, sailing vessels, motor-boats and
yachts are constantly passing, and the sight is full of pleasant variety.
A walk to the old Martello Tower may be enjoyed by striking in
from the sea over one of the ingoing paths; and enjoyable walks
by the old Chain Fort, past the masked batteries, and around to
the beautiful prospect of the North-West Arm, are all of convenient
length, The Club House of the Royal Nova Scotian Yacht Squadron
is near the Pleasant Street entrance to the park.</p>
<p>The Public Gardens are easily accessible from almost any
part of the city, being centrally situated. There are larger, but no
finer botanical gardens than these, and the spreading trees, the shady
walks, the ponds and lakes, the trim-kept green, the plants, and the
great beds of splendid flowers, always in constant succession of bloom,
make the &ldquo;Gardens&rdquo; a beautiful spot. It is a favorite centre of outdoor
recreation and life, and here military band concerts and garden
and water <i>fetes</i> are given through the summer.</p>

<p>Everyone living anywhere
near Halifax takes great pride in
the beautiful expanse of water
known as the North-West Arm. It
is, as its name indicates, an arm of
the sea that branches off from the
bay and flows inland to the south
of the city, in a north-westerly
direction. It is about four miles long, and is crowned on each side
by wooded banks. It is a great centre for canoeing, rowing, yachting,
motor-boating, etc., as well as for bathing, diving, swimming
and general aquatic sport. Here in the height of the summer the
famous regattas are held, when the numerous club house porches,
the banks of the water and every available spot is occupied to witness
the races. The sight is gay, unique and peculiar, in its extent, to
Halifax. The excursion steamers, sailing vessels, tugs, and boats
of every description, as well as private yachts, launches, rowing
boats and canoes that line the long course make an exhilarating
scene, and one that brings many from hundreds of miles distant to
witness it.</p>
<p>Cricket, golf, tennis, curling, boating, canoeing, bathing and
diving may all be enjoyed in or near the city; and the locality is a
centre for good fishing and the best of hunting.</p>
<p>Of the many favorite drives, one of the best is that along the
shore of the Bedford Basin. High hills look down on the noble
sheet of water, and at Bellevue, Bedford, etc., are comfortable stopping-places.
Here the Duke of Kent lived, at that part of the shore
known as Prince&rsquo;s Lodge. The house has fallen in ruins, and all
that remains is the bandstand. Many pretty bungalows and pleasant
summer places are found along the shore.</p>
<p>Along this shore camped the survivors of the great French
Armada of 1746, that was to have conquered all British America.
Of the 40 warships and 30 transports that left Brest, only a scattered
remnant survived storm and disaster and was able to return to the
home port. Halifax, Louisbourg and Annapolis were all to have
been taken from the British by this formidable fleet. But disaster
followed in the wake of nearly every vessel of the great squadron;
for after being dispersed and scattered by heavy storms that destroyed
many vessels of the fleet, the survivors became the prey of
a violent and fatal sickness. They wintered along the shore of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">256</span>
Bedford Basin, and died there by thousands.
The commander, d&rsquo;Anville, died suddenly and
was buried on the island now known as George&rsquo;s
Island. The second in command, D&rsquo;Estournel,
committed suicide on his sword, in a fit of
despair. La Jonqui&egrave;re then assumed command
of the weakened and dispirited force. He burned
one of his frigates, and other vessels, the remains
of which may still be seen in the Bedford
Basin near the Three-Mile House, and also
close to Navy Island. Then rallying his command
he left to attack Annapolis, but again
was the fleet battered and dispersed by storms,
and the survivors had to endure many hardships before they reached
their native France. Rust-eaten muskets and swords have frequently
been found along the Bedford shore when clearing away
the underbrush.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_246">
<img src="images/p0264.jpg" alt="" width="309" height="499" />
</div>
<p>Other good routes are those to Dutch Village and the Dingle,
to the Chain Lakes, and to the Rocking Stone on the way to St.
Margaret&rsquo;s Bay.</p>
<p>Lawrencetown, about two hours&rsquo; drive from Dartmouth, has
a good beach with surf-bathing, and may be reached by stage.
Chezzetcook, an old Acadian settlement, is also quite accessible in the
same way. York Redoubt, Falkland Village and Herring Cove all
make pleasant drives.</p>
<p>The Musquodoboit River country to the east of Halifax had
French settlements fully half a century before the first British
settler arrived at what is now the great stronghold and capital
city of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Crossing to Dartmouth on the ferry a pleasant road leads
to the Dartmouth Lakes. This beautiful chain of lakes is part of a
system of waterways intended to be made continuous from Halifax
and Dartmouth to the Bay of Fundy, at Maitland and Cobequid
Bay, by means of the Shubenacadie River. A canal was to have
connected the lakes and river, but the project fell through. The
ruins of the old locks at the Dartmouth end are well worth seeing.
Excellent views may be enjoyed from Dartmouth and Prince Arthur
Parks. Many camping parties are found on the shores of the first
and second lakes, and boating is there a favorite recreation.</p>
<p>Another pleasant road is that to Cow Bay, where a fine beach
and good bathing may be enjoyed.</p>

<p>Enjoyable trips may be made from Halifax to the Minas
Basin, Grand Pr&eacute;, and the Annapolis Valley; along the south shore
to St. Margaret&rsquo;s Bay, Chester, and Mahone Bay, Liverpool, Lockeport
and Shelburne, and to Lakes Rossignol, Keejim-Koojie,
Ponhook, etc.</p>
<p>No port of Canada offers the numerous water trips that may
be made from Halifax. Steamers leave here for St. John&rsquo;s,
Newfoundland; St. Pierre-Miquelon, Magdalen Islands, Pictou
and Prince Edward Island, Gasp&eacute; peninsular points, Sydney,
Ingonish, Aspy Bay, Louisbourg, Glace Bay, Bras d&rsquo;Or Lakes, Port

and other ports in the Strait of Canso; Country Harbor,
Isaacs Harbor, Sherbrooke, Liscomb, Sonora, Jeddore, Ship Harbor,
Tangier, Sheet Harbor, and many places along the east shore; Lunenburg,
Liverpool, Shelburne, Yarmouth on the south shore; St. John,
N.B.; and finally, not including transatlantic ports, there are trips
to Jamaica and Santiago: and to New York, Boston and Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Other particulars of Halifax and eastern shore localities will
be found in the chapter on &ldquo;Where to Go.&rdquo; The deep-sea fisheries
of the South Shore are very large and important, and at Halifax
and elsewhere along the coast ample opportunities are found for
catching swordfish, leaping tuna, mackerel, codfish and haddock,
etc. Whaling was formerly carried
on by numerous vessels outfitting
and sailing from Halifax. A settlement
of Nantucket Whalers was
made in Dartmouth, but they afterwards
left; and the whaling industry
gradually died out as a result of
the great slaughter of those fish in
early days.</p>

<p>Between Truro and Stellarton there
is a continuance of the pleasant
scenery found in the Truro Valley;
but the Northumberland Straits
Shore and neighboring territory
between Oxford Junction and Stellarton,
and beyond that to Mulgrave
and the Strait of Canso, has features
of its own quite unlike those of the
country previously described. The nearest approach in general
characteristics is found at the mouth of the Miramichi, and in the
neighborhood of Point du Chene. It is a country of meadow lands
and tranquil rivers, although as Antigonish and other places are
approached the meadows are frequently varied by the addition of
hills and occasional rolling land.</p>
<p class="tb">It is a land of verdure and freshness; and if bold mountain
ranges are absent, in their place will be found prolific meadows,
luxurious tree-growth, quiet streams, singing birds, and abundant
floral life.</p>

<p>Pugwash is a quiet and modest
little watering place on the Northumberland
Straits, only a short run from Oxford
Junction. There is bathing on the shore,
and boating in the excellent harbor. Some
<span class="pb" id="Page_261">261</span>
bungalows have been erected in a fine
situation for the water view and the cool
evening air. Like most of the places
that are a little remote from the beaten
highway of travel, Pugwash is quite
quaint in its appearance and everyday
life. The streets are very pleasant, there
are plenty of river views and walks, and
there are many good roads. It is one
of those places where a very quiet and restful summer may be
spent at very moderate expense.</p>

<p>The scenery by Tatamagouche River, and also by the Swiss
settlement of River John, is very enjoyable. A pleasing sheet of water
is at Tatamagouche. The land is low, but the bay winds and turns and
has little coves in it, so that it makes an attractive waterway for
boating and canoeing. Malagash Point makes out at the far western
extremity of the main bay. The Tatamagouche is a pretty little
stream with picturesque banks&mdash;the flat country here gradually
taking a moderate elevation in parts. River John is a stream of fair
proportions, nicely wooded with young trees along its gentle sloping
banks of brightest green. Going east from here the country becomes
somewhat undulating, and on approaching Lyon&rsquo;s Brook and Pictou,
hills of bolder height are seen.</p>
<p>The country through which we are passing is that of the
blackbird and the bobolink, and the rivers, water reaches and tall
grasses are the homes of wild fowl of almost every kind.</p>

<p>Pictou is situated on a fine
harbor, possibly the finest along
the shore, which has three rivers
emptying into it. It is a delightful
little summer resort, where
many enjoyable drives may be
taken into the surrounding country. Walks about will reveal many
charming spots. There are pretty brooks, and refreshing woodland
walks. The boating is excellent, and the nearby shore offers pleasant
variety in coves and tiny creeks. There is a clean sand beach for
sheltered or harbor bathing. Good trout fishing will also be found in
the surrounding streams. Lord Strathcona has a summer home in the
neighborhood. The East River communicates with New Glasgow,
only some 9 miles distant. The growing town of Westville is on the
Middle River. West River has much pretty scenery along its course,
and it is here that most of the fishing is done.</p>
<p>Pictou was once the site of a large Indian village. Later the
French tried to build up a settlement and they were followed by
Pennsylvanians from the neighborhood of Philadelphia. Finally,
many hardy Highlanders found their way here, and by them the
real settlement was made. At the mouth of Pictou harbor the last
fight between the Kennebec and Micmac Indians took place.</p>
<p>Stages leave here for many places of interest along the shore,
and also to some inland points. Steamships also leave for Prince
Edward Island, for Quebec and
St. Lawrence Gulf ports, for
Hawkesbury and the Strait of
Canso, and for West Cape Breton
and the Magdalen Islands.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_256">

<p>The country between Truro and Stellarton on the southern
loop or main line of the Intercolonial Railway has not been opened
up or developed for summer visitors. It is nevertheless a beautiful
country; and walks, drives and excursions by rail from Truro or
New Glasgow along the pretty hills, vales and streams will bring
much pleasure.</p>
<p>Stellarton and New Glasgow are growing and prosperous
coal-mining and manufacturing centres. Stellarton is the centre
of a coal district from which immense quantities of that valuable
fuel have been mined. New Glasgow is a bright and up-to-date
town with excellent stores and commercial facilities. There are
pleasant drives along the East River, and to the south.</p>
<p>Proceeding east past Merigomish and other small places, the
very interesting and pretty town of Antigonish, at the head of a small
harbor on St. George&rsquo;s Bay, is reached. It is a Scottish settlement
that has more individuality and charm than would be thought possible
for a town on a railroad. It is a place of pleasant shady streets,
picturesque hills, winding streams and numerous bridges. Its fine
Catholic Cathedral and modern College are conspicuous objects from
all around. Antigonish is not spoiled by the proximity of a large
city, and so the life of the surrounding country centres in the busy
little place; and it is one of those delightful places that somehow
appeal to the heart from the first moment of arrival.</p>
<p>The harbor is some distance off, and, being shallow, is little
used. There are very pleasant drives in every direction. For a
pleasant stay in a pretty country town, few places will please more
than this; and for those who like that pastime, some canoeing may
be done in the adjacent waters. The climate is very enjoyable,
mild and temperate. The nights are lovely.</p>

</div>
<p>Antigonish is an important centre for stage coach and other
drives to many places of great interest. The route to Lochaber,
College Lake and Sherbrooke leads past the Antigonish Mountains to
the St. Mary&rsquo;s River and Atlantic Ocean on the south, and is full of
variety. There are drives to Morristown and Georgeville, and to
Malignant Cove by a delightful road through the hills. It was here
that the British frigate <i>Malignant</i> took the shore in a heavy gale.
Near here is the Scottish settlement of Arisaig, which has a romantic
situation and a little shelter-harbor.</p>
<p>At Heatherton Station a stage may be taken for Guysboro at
the head of Chedabucto Bay. It is a most interesting drive. Beyond
Heatherton lies Tracadie, a quaint French district where there
is a Trappist Monastery, the Belgian Monks of which make excellent
farmers. Both in Tracadie and Harbor au Bouche a quaint old-time
life is lived, and the places are well worth a visit.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_258">
<img src="images/p0273.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="396" />
</div>
<p>Proceeding now to the most easterly railroad point in peninsular
Nova Scotia, the village of Mulgrave is reached. Mulgrave is
on the Strait of Canso, the much-travelled marine highway from
the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and by the use of
which the long voyage around the Island of Cape Breton is rendered
unnecessary. It has been termed
the &ldquo;Golden Gate of the St.
Lawrence,&rdquo; and without doubt
is a most picturesque waterway.
Thousands of vessels pass through
here every year, and at almost
any hour of the day the sight is
a pleasant one and full of variety.
Bold and plentifully wooded hills
flank the splendid waterway for a
<span class="pb" id="Page_266">266</span>
considerable length of its fifteen-mile course. Here
the Intercolonial Railway ferry crosses and recrosses
to Cape Breton Island on the opposite
shore of the Strait, carrying over passengers,
cars, etc., to and from Sydney and intermediate
stations on the island. There are many pleasant
trips from Mulgrave by steamboat to Guysboro,
Canso, Arichat, Port Hawkesbury and Port
Hastings, Bras d&rsquo;Or Lake by way of St.
Peter&rsquo;s, Port Hood, Margaree and Cheticamp
on the West shore of Cape Breton, and to
Montague and Georgetown on Prince Edward
Island.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_259">
<img src="images/p0274.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="500" />
</div>
<p>The town of Guysboro is quite an old settlement, for Nicholas
St. Denys had a fishing station at the place now known as Fort Point.
The fisheries here have always been very valuable, and Chedabucto,
at the head of which Guysboro is, has been the resort of many vessels
engaged in fishing for mackerel, herring, codfish and pollock. The
settlement itself with its long street of most generous width lying
along the water, at a little distance from it, and the grassy little
streets on the overlooking hills, is very attractive as a quiet summer
resort, with good boating and canoeing. As a centre for sailing and
excursions by water, and also for drives in every direction, it is
excellent. Being somewhat remote, it is a place where a restful
summer may be spent, with cool air and genial surroundings. Like
Antigonish, it is a place with a homelike air that takes the fancy
from the very first; and here, of course, boating and fishing are at
the very door. There are pleasant water trips nearby to Milford
Haven and Boylston, and innumerable longer excursions to places
on Chedabucto Bay, to Isle Madame and other Cape Breton
points, as well as to Hawkesbury and Mulgrave on the Strait
of Canso. There are good drives, also, with fishing sport, to
Salmon River and surrounding lakes, as well as to Whitehead, Tor
Bay and other places on the outer Atlantic coast. In summer
the water of Chedabucto Bay is ordinarily quiet and smooth, and
it takes just a moment to pass out into the open bay from
Guysboro&rsquo;s little shelter-harbor. When a gale blows from the east,
the sea piles up in rollers and sweeps up to the harbor entrance in
fine commotion. It is a place half-country and half-shore, with sea
life predominating.</p>

</div>
<p>The coast line west of Chedabucto Bay is rich in bays and
roomy inlets, with numerous lakes and rivers in communication.
The St. Mary&rsquo;s River waters a fine tract of country, and connects
with the beautiful Lochaber Lake some thirty miles inland. A stage-coach
drive across the peninsula from beautiful Antigonish to the
head navigation waters of the St. Mary&rsquo;s River at Sherbrooke is an
enjoyable summer outing. The scenery is finely varied, and the
whole district is full of interest.</p>
<p>On the middle St. Mary&rsquo;s River good salmon fishing is often
found at the Crow&rsquo;s Nest, a typical interior country place.</p>
<p>Considerable salmon fishing with nets is carried on in the
lower waters of the river between Sherbrooke and Sonora on the
coast, a distance of about nine miles.</p>
<p>The village of Sherbrooke has a very pleasant situation on
the river, and it is one of those quiet and remote places where a
thoroughly restful vacation may be enjoyed by those who love
country life and pleasant rambles. There is excellent boating at
Sherbrooke, as well as above and below it. Motor-boats have a
fine nine-mile run to the ocean, with numerous excursion points
within easy reach of the mouth of the river.</p>
<p>The canoeing waters of Sherbrooke are excellent. A delightful
holiday may be spent by making headquarters in the village
to explore the upper waters of the river. There are pleasant settlements
all along the course up to its head waters. Being remote
from regular travel routes, the district is fresh and unspoiled; and
those who enjoy absolute quiet, unconventional life and a friendly
welcome will be sure to feel at home in Sherbrooke.</p>
<p>Country Harbour to the east, and Sheet Harbour, Port
Dufferin and Musquodoboit to the west are all pleasant little places.</p>

<p>A railroad is to be built, along the south-east shore between
Halifax and Guysboro. When it is finished, the fine harbors and the
rugged and romantic places along the shore will be brought within
easy reach of the summer visitor. In the meantime such places are
fairly accessible by stage-coach from points on the Intercolonial
Railway between Shubenacadie and Heatherton or Antigonish; and
they may also be reached by steamboat from Halifax and Guysboro
or Mulgrave.</p>

<div class="img" id="pic_264">
<img src="images/p0279.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="453" />
</div>
<p>Cape Breton Island, lying at the
entrance to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, has
been termed the &ldquo;front door&rdquo; of Canada;
a distinction that should properly be
shared with Newfoundland; for the naval
power that holds these Atlantic outposts
could destroy or dominate the whole
maritime trade of the great river.</p>
<p>If the Norse voyagers discovered
North America, and sailed into the Gulf of St. Lawrence a thousand
years ago, as many believe, they must have passed by and seen
Cape Breton; and, in all probability, they must have been the first
Europeans to land upon its shore.</p>
<p>The first name of the Island, Baccalaos, is held by some to
indicate an early visitation of the Portuguese, much earlier than
Cabot&rsquo;s time; for Baccalaos is a Portuguese word meaning &ldquo;cod
fish,&rdquo; and it is well known that early European fishermen frequented
these waters, and engaged in the cod fishing. The Portuguese are
believed to have made some attempt to found a settlement at or
near the present village of Ingonish. It is not certain whether
Cabot landed here on his voyage of discovery in the year 1497; nor
has it been established that Verazzano, the Florentine navigator,
landed at or near Cape Breton in the year 1524. It is not even
certain that Jacques Cartier landed on the island in any of his three
American voyages, although he is thought to have given the old
French name of Loreine to a cape at the northern end of the Island.</p>
<p>In the reign of Queen Elizabeth a British mariner is said to
have visited Cape Breton. His name was Richard Strong, and he
came in his little bark, the <i>Marigold</i>, of 70 tons. He is supposed to
have landed near where the town of Louisbourg now is. About
this time fur-trading commenced to attract European sailors, and by
the close of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign fully two hundred English vessels
were engaged in bartering for furs, and fishing for cod and other
fish in upper North American waters.</p>
<p>Cape Breton received its present name from the Breton
fishermen who either &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; the Island, or, what is more likely,
<span class="pb" id="Page_272">272</span>
fished in its waters. It is easy to understand that where they congregated
to fish might most readily be named the Bay or the Cape
of the Bretons. During the time that it was a French possession
it was by them called L&rsquo;Isle Royale, but since 1758 it has been known
by the name it now bears.</p>
<p>With the exception of some low lying and undeveloped places
on the south shore, the whole Island offers all that the summer
visitor holds dear, bold scenery and fine prospects, charming vale
and river districts, beautiful woods, romantic gorges, sparkling waterfalls,
sunny skies, delightful temperature, and invigorating air.
The summers from May to October are probably as enjoyable as
those in the most favored part of the world that may be chosen for
comparison. For its northern and eastern position there is remarkable
immunity from fog. The southern end is where fog may
be seen when it prevails.</p>
<p>Only those that have gone over the whole ground can realize
the wealth of picturesque beauty and variety found in Eastern
Quebec and the Maritime Provinces of Canada, and this variety is
again exemplified in Cape Breton; for after passing from Quebec
to New Brunswick, from New Brunswick to Prince Edward Island,
and thence to southern and eastern Nova Scotia, and finding constant
variety at almost every stage&mdash;here in Cape Breton the contrast
is still maintained. The growing popularity of these provinces is
perhaps only natural when their situation and advantages are considered.
They are rapidly becoming what nature evidently intended
they should be&mdash;international vacation grounds for the
people of the western hemisphere.</p>
<p>There are no fashionable resorts in Cape Breton. For the
majority this is perhaps one of its strongest recommendations.
There are luxuries in a few centres, and comforts in many more,
with plain but substantial living in most of the smaller places. The
railroad mileage is not very extensive, as yet, but it is supplemented
by steamboat traffic along the east, west and south coasts, and over
the waters of the Bras d&rsquo;Or Lake. Carriages are used for reaching
interior parts that are remote from rail or steamboat routes. Because
of this a systematic description following the coast line, etc.,
is not advisable, and in place of it the plan is followed of describing
the accessible parts of the island from the chief centres of railway,
steamboat and carriage travel.</p>

<p>Whether seen on foot, or from
train, steamboat or carriage, there can
be no doubt that Cape Breton is one of
the most enjoyable spots on earth.
Gushing springs, dancing rills, plashing
brooks, cascading rivulets, musical
streams, murmuring rivers, everywhere.
What a wealth of graceful ferns; what gardens of wildflowers;
what splendid trees and noble forests; what tranquil vales;
what majestic mountains! And the blue sea, the crested waves,
the milky foam, the fleecy clouds! Surely such scenes as these were
in Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s mind when he wrote his Highland Scene:</p>

<p>The early settlement of Cape Breton was entirely French.
At the time of the expulsion of the Acadians from the peninsular
part of Nova Scotia, many took refuge in the then L&rsquo;Isle Royale, or
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
Cape Breton. The early French, and
the Acadians by whom they were afterwards
joined, have retained their old
life in a remarkable degree. It is a
delight to meet them in modern up-to-date
America. Scottish Highlanders,
too, are in Cape Breton in large
numbers; and the virtues and customs
of this rugged and estimable people may
be studied against the pleasant background of mountain and flood,
so like the home scenery of &ldquo;Caledonia, stern and wild.&rdquo; Micmac
Indians are here, too; but not in such great numbers as formerly.</p>

<p>First, following the line of the Intercolonial Railway from
Point Tupper by way of the Bras d&rsquo;Or Lake to Sydney, the general
appearance of the country may be noticed.</p>
<p>The first view of the Island when approaching by the railway
ferry is quite impressive, although the peculiar features do not grow
until the interior is gradually reached. After passing McIntyre&rsquo;s
Lake there is considerable up-grade to gain the height of the bold
hills that are capped in the distance by a still higher formation.
The scene as the height is gained is very striking, entirely distinct
in character from either the open, soft beauty of the Wentworth
Valley, or the combination of river, forest and mountain seen in the
Matapedia district.</p>
<p>Here an immense valley lies in the very depths to the left.
The tops of the trees are far below, and, although we climb up and
up, the great trees still crowd the forest, with here and there a glistening
stream showing through the valley rifts. The woodland
view is one of unparalleled grandeur.</p>
<p>Descending, we skirt a huge mountain with tier after tier of
woodland stretching up into the heights; and here we dash out on
an elevated plateau to see a peaceful hamlet smiling in white and
green in the tranquil depths below.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_268">
<img src="images/p0283a.jpg" alt="" width="311" height="499" />
</div>
<p>River Denys is a pretty stream of modest
proportions running at the foot of, and almost
shut in by tall trees that tower up majestically
in all the glory of height and symmetry. A
peculiar and picturesque aspect is given to the
woodland by the tall and slender birches, like palm
trees&mdash;devoid of branch and leaf below, and having
only a feathery, outspreading growth at the top.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>There is a pleasing water view at Orangedale, with a charming
vista of green shores stretching out to the lake. The first impression
of the Bras d&rsquo;Or Lake is one of peaceful calm, as the evening sun
crimsons the broad and far-reaching expanse of water.</p>
<p>The Great Bras d&rsquo;Or Lake is about 45 miles long and nearly
20 miles wide. It is very deep in nearly every part of it, varying
from 90 to 350 feet. In one place a depth of 1200 feet has been
found, just a short distance from the shore. Old maps and references
give the name &ldquo;Labrador&rdquo; for this beautiful lake. It may also be
mentioned that Nicholas Denys published a book in Paris in the
latter half of the seventeenth century in which he refers to the Bras
d&rsquo;Or Lake as &ldquo;Le Lac de Labrador.&rdquo; The present name is undoubtedly
founded on the old one. It is almost identical in pronunciation,
too; and as it has a meaning, &ldquo;arm of gold,&rdquo; that describes the appearance
of the lake at sunrise and sunset, it has come into general
use.</p>
<p>The Little Bras d&rsquo;Or Lake, exclusive of channels, is about
ten miles long; its breadth nearly six miles. It has a depth of 700
feet in places. Two peninsulas nearly meet at the Grand Narrows
and thus almost separate the Great from the Little Bras d&rsquo;Or. The
two lakes are called the Bras d&rsquo;Or Lakes; but because their waters
communicate so that a passage from one to the other may easily be
made through the Grand Narrows channel, the whole water system
is now frequently called the Bras d&rsquo;Or Lake.</p>
<p>The Bras d&rsquo;Or Lake is really an inland sea, or, more correctly,
an arm of the Atlantic Ocean. In the waters of the upper or smaller
of the two lakes is the long and narrow island, Boularderie, some 28
miles long, and nearly three miles wide at its northern end, where it
fronts on the Atlantic. East and west of it are channels or inlets
from the ocean. That on the east, tide-swept and impassable for
large boats, is the Little Bras d&rsquo;Or or St. Andrews channel. The
wider channel on the west side may be traversed by any vessel afloat,
as it has a depth of from thirty to two hundred feet. Both channels
lead south through the Grand Narrows into the larger of the two
lakes, where at the southern end the narrow isthmus has been cut,
and where a canal with locks enables vessels to pass in and out.</p>
<p>It has been said of the Bras d&rsquo;Or that it is the most beautiful
salt-water lake ever seen. The substance of Warner&rsquo;s comment is
seen to be true by all who visit these shores. &ldquo;The water runs into
lovely bays and lagoons, having slender tongues of land and picturesque
islands. It has all the pleasantness of a fresh-water lake,
<span class="pb" id="Page_277">277</span>
with all the advantages of a salt one.&rdquo; There is practically no tide,
the comparatively narrow sea entrances acting to resist the flow of
water out and in. The difference in level is usually less than a foot.</p>

<p class="caption">Boularderie Island, Bras d&rsquo;Or Lake</p>
</div>
<p>One or more of the numerous cruises on these waters, described
later, should be taken, as well as the journey over the railway, now
resumed.</p>
<p>The view of the lake as McKinnon&rsquo;s Harbor is approached is
beautiful. The tree growth is larger, fantastic little islands dot the
smooth water, and the whole panorama of mainland, island and
broad lake is indeed magnificent. Nearing Iona the peculiar appearance
of the landscape whitened by the outcroppings of gypsum
or plaster rock is very noticeable. In many places the shore view
of headland and water is very similar to that on the Atlantic coast,
except in the placidity of the water. At Ottawa Brook a lovely
<span class="pb" id="Page_278">278</span>
view of island-dotted lake is seen
stretching out in a far-away and
pleasing vista to the south. At a
small siding, nearby, a small meadow
stream meanders fantastically
through a verdant plain that is
dotted with haystacks, and has here
and there little bridges raised high
above the general level to keep them
secure in the time of spring and
flood&mdash;a time of utmost consequence
to farmers of intervale, for it brings
rich deposits of alluvial mud to fertilize the low-lying fields.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_270">
<img src="images/p0286.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="497" />
</div>
<p>From Iona, and Grand Narrows on the opposite shore, the
steamer <i>Bluehill</i> makes connections for Baddeck, and from Grand
Narrows another boat leaves for St. Peter&rsquo;s and other points. At
Iona station, by the &ldquo;narrows,&rdquo; passengers may take the opportunity
of alighting to see the fine Intercolonial Railway bridge that spans
the channel. It has a &ldquo;draw&rdquo; near the Grand Narrows side to allow
vessels to pass from upper lake to lower, or the reverse. Grand
Narrows attracts tourists to its comfortable hotel on the water, as
it makes a good centre for seeing the surrounding country. It is
also a place of call for the lake steamboats. There are fine views to
be had in the vicinity.</p>
<p>The run over the railway from Grand Narrows by Boisdale,
Barachois and George&rsquo;s River to Sydney is a pleasant one along
the eastern shore of the upper lake; and it should be made both
ways in order to see the water after sunrise and at sunset&mdash;the
two effects being quite different. Journeying and looking out on
the shore, at times a sandy crescent is seen to run out into the
lake and terminate in gentle mound, green sward and comely tree-growth.
Often there are small lakes, and frequently a little chain
of such; and at these places, with the boats of the fishermen drawn
up on the strand between the great lakes and the lakes in miniature,
the scene is novel and most striking.</p>
<p>Here are two sandy arms running out, and drawing together
at their outer ends&mdash;forming a harbor within a harbor&mdash;where a
little flotilla of brown-sailed fishing craft rides snugly, protected
even from the windy scud of a stormy day.</p>

<p>Over there a small headland of some forty feet in height has
lost its crown of brown rocks that lie in picturesque disorder at its
base, lapped by the gentle ripple
of the tide, and mimicking the
giant scenes of the rugged Atlantic
shore. Nor are bolder effects wanting,
for yonder, across the channel,
a huge mountain rises proudly to
the sky; and it, too, has thrown
part of its rocky cap down and far out into the deeper tide.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_272">
<img src="images/p0288a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="290" />
</div>
<p>No more beautiful view of mountain, blue water and gently-sloping
wooded shore can be seen than that between Barachois and
Sydney River; and on a morning when the bright sun has dissipated
the early mists, and rides resplendent in a sky dotted here and there
with fleecy clouds, the picture is truly superb.</p>
<p>The pleasing effect of the tree-dotted sand bars running out
from the shore&mdash;making lagoons whose tranquil silver surfaces,
protected by tiny headlands, show in delightful contrast with the
deep blue of the more ruffled outer waters&mdash;must be seen before an
adequate conception of their great beauty can be formed. There
is a great difference between coast scenery and that of what
may be termed an inner coast shore, such as that of the Bras
d&rsquo;Or Lake.</p>
<p>If the scenery of outer coast is striking and grand in its rugged
majesty, that of the calmer and more protected inner shore compels
admiration for its softer effects&mdash;no less striking in their tranquil
beauty&mdash;scenic miniatures in nature&rsquo;s most exquisite setting.</p>
<p>The city of Sydney has become the centre of a district that
is rapidly increasing in population and commercial importance. It
is the capital of Cape Breton, and the great mining and manufacturing
industries of the Island centre altogether in this eastern
district. It is the present terminus of the Intercolonial Railway.
It has an exceedingly fine harbor. This harbor is divided into
two arms, known as the ports of Sydney and North Sydney, and
the average depth of water is fifty feet. The water area is very
extensive, so much so that
Sydney ranks as one of the
world&rsquo;s great harbors. The
north and south bars at the
entrance act as natural break-waters,
and the inner waters
are easy of access.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_273">

<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p>While it is generally known that the distance from Sydney
to Liverpool is much less than that from New York to the British
port, it will come as a great surprise to most when they learn how
much closer Sydney is than New York to points in South America
and South Africa. For instance, Pernambuco, at the most easterly
projection of the South American continent, is nearer to Sydney than
New York by 24 miles. New Orleans, an extreme southern port of
the United States, is even more distant from the South American
point named by a stretch of over 575 miles; and, strange as it may
seem, the voyage to the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa is very
much shorter from Sydney than from United States ports.</p>
<p>Sydney River offers a broad and pleasant stream for boating.
The country by the lower part is flat, but becomes hilly and nicely
wooded as the upper waters are gained. For some distance inland
there are excellent runs for motor-boating, sailing, rowing and canoeing.
Crawley&rsquo;s Creek is also a good boating place. There are
many pleasant drives to the lakes in the vicinity, as well as to many
pretty inlets on the coast, and by the inner waters of the harbor.
There is an excellent view from Victoria Park at the end of the peninsula.
The district surrounding Sydney has a number of pleasant
features, and the city itself may be chosen as a centre for excursions
to Port Morien, the Mira River and Louisbourg.</p>
<p>North Sydney is the port from which the steamers of the
Reid-Newfoundland line leave for Port-aux-Basques, Newfoundland;
and from this port steamers may be taken for St. John&rsquo;s, Newfoundland,
as well as to Hawkesbury, Halifax, Charlottetown,
Montreal, Quebec, St. Pierre and Miquelon. There is a good ferry
service between here and Sydney, local lines for points on the Bras
d&rsquo;Or Lakes, and, in addition, there are steamers to northern points
along the eastern shore of Cape Breton.</p>
<p>Those who visit here from the great manufacturing and
mining centres of the United States will, of course, be familiar with
coal mining and steel plants; but many others who come from other
industrial centres will find it both interesting and instructive to
visit the works of the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Company and
collieries, etc., in the neighborhood. The various industries of
this kind hereabouts will soon rival the giant industries of Pennsylvania;
and all interested in such industries should spend some days
in seeing the many novel sights they offer. Those who have never
seen a similar sight should by all means see a cast made at the Dominion
Steel Works. The coal industry is now an immense one. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_282">282</span>
these days of coal at seven dollars a ton it seems strange to read that
at the time of the inglorious Quebec Expedition under Admiral
Walker, coal in quantities was taken from the Sydney cliffs with
iron crow-bars.</p>

</div>
<p>The Marconi &ldquo;Wireless&rdquo; Station at Table Head, Glace Bay,
with its four towers, is sure to be an object of interest to all who go
near this part of the coast.</p>
<p>That giant fish the Albacore, or leaping-tuna, weighing from
500 to 800 pounds and over, is caught along the North Atlantic
coast in certain favored spots. At Lockeport and other places on
the South Shore of Nova Scotia they are caught in great trap nets.
They are also caught off the Cape Breton coast; and as the honor
of catching the first of these monstrous fish with rod and line not
far from Sydney fell to the well-known sportsman, Mr. Ross, of
Montreal, a description from Patillo of a hand-line expedition for
albacore is here given.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stout cod-lines were used, 32 fathoms long. The hook was
of steel, three-eighths of an inch thick. It was eight inches wide,
<span class="pb" id="Page_283">283</span>
and had a three-inch shank. A stiff, moderately low boat was
used, and the lines were attached to swivel reels to run them on and
off. Herrings were taken for bait. We started off and soon reached
the fishing ground. Presently one of the fishermen casting nets
nearby called out to us, &lsquo;Halloa, boys! here&rsquo;s a fellow!&rsquo; meaning
an albacore, followed by a shout from another, and still another
that they were about their boats; so we slowly moved outside the
range of the boats, throwing over a herring every few yards to toll
them along with us. When far enough away we secured the reel to
the boat athwart, for we were a bit afraid of the fish we expected to
grapple with. Then I threw over a herring to see if there were any
albacores near us, and to our delight a monster rushed for it just
under the surface, so I threw another loose herring, and then one
attached to the hook. He rushed for the first one, whirled and took
hold of the other, and we had hold of him. Then for a few minutes
we had a good imitation of the antics of a wild prairie horse when
first haltered. He jumped his full length out of the water, which
gave us a very vivid idea of the monster we were attached to; then
he started at an awful pace across the harbor. The line was running
out swiftly, so that we had to move as quickly to get it into the
notch in the stern, which we had wisely thought to make. Then I
seized an oar and placed it for steering, while we both got positions
to trim the boat. We feared something might break if the boat
remained motionless; so to obviate this my friend succeeded in
grasping the line partially, and thereby gradually started the boat,
while I helped by sculling, so that by the time it was all off the reel,
she was moving faster than ever she did before. The fish kept up
the pace for at least ten minutes, towing us directly into the harbor;
then he made a jump, turned and took us straight back to the fishing
grounds. The men in fishing boats had been watching us with great
interest, not supposing for a moment they were to have any part
in it; but when they saw us going directly for them, the shouting
and hooting and swearing that suddenly started from them would
have been laughable to disinterested spectators. We could see
plainly that if he continued the course he was then taking us, nothing
short of a collision with one or more of the boats would follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pandemonium appeared about to reign. The boats were
very near. We were all greatly excited, for we realized there was
danger of foundering. I jumped with my knife to free the fish. In
the rush my foot slipped, and I went headlong on my mate, the
knife flying overboard. Before anything could be done to free the
<span class="pb" id="Page_284">284</span>
albacore, we ran into a boat with a heavy crash, filling it with water,
and upsetting most of their herring. The sudden resistance caused
the albacore to spring again, when, to save ourselves from being
spilled out, one of the men cut the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the boats were baled out and work resumed. After the
danger was over we all roared with laughter, scream after scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The freed albacore paraded all around the harbor that day,
jumping out of the water dozens of times with our line still attached
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing so many around, we decided to try for another. The
fishermen, however, hesitated about supplying us with bait, fearing
a repetition of the peril if we hooked another. After coaxing, we got
what we wanted and started off again, throwing herrings as we went.
When we thought ourselves well out we stopped to make ready for
another strike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stood up and threw out a herring. In a moment it was
grabbed. Then the baited hook went over, was seized in a trice,
and once more we had a fish. This second fellow was even more
lively than the first, and his rushing and jumping was something
wonderful to witness. He began pulling us off at once. To make
his speed less we crossed our oars and held back water, which acted
like a drag. Suddenly like the other, he turned at right angles and
led us off in the new direction, fully ten minutes. Then he headed
for the boats&mdash;mischief in his eye. We were now threatened with
mishap worse than before, for the boats were by this time deeply
loaded. What was to be done? He made another leap at this
juncture, falling more clumsily than before. He was weakening!
The men in the boats were now gesticulating and yelling for us to
set him free. But we were growing hopeful as the speed of the boat
grew perceptibly less. Soon we were able to gather in line to within
a few fathoms of him. Within 150 yards of the boats he stopped
short. We hauled up. What a beauty! Ten feet long, and weighing
over 600 pounds. Three cheers were given as with a rope through
his gills we towed him to the beach. We gave him to the men whose
herrings we had spilled. Surely a royal sport. The equal of any
fishing on the Pacific Coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Port Morien is reached by the Sydney and Louisbourg Railway,
a line running east to the coast, and then south to Louisbourg. The
little town on the coast has a harbor, breakwater, excellent beach,
and a considerable fish industry. It also has valuable coal deposits.</p>

</div>
<p>The Mira River district,
half-way down the coast towards
Louisbourg, abounds in picturesque
views; and a journey over the
beautiful river, with its remarkable
clear water, is a veritable treat.
An old French shipyard was once
here, some remains of which are
still visible; and the hulls of many small craft may be seen below
water. The course leads through a ravine that is sheltered from the
sun for most of the day, the coves and small headlands of which give
many pretty views. Pleasant fishing streams and brooks empty themselves
along the course of the Mira River, and numerous evidences
of the early French days are seen as the upper waters are reached.
Pleasant islands, also, vary the way, some of them in picturesque
clusters. A number of inviting-looking bays and several villages
are passed, and as Marion Bridge is gained the country becomes more
hilly and varied. Salmon River, which empties into the Mira, is a
favorite fishing stream, and, in addition, it offers many beautiful
views. Near the head of Mira River is Victoria Bridge, from which
pleasant drives may be taken to Gaberouse on the bay of that name,
to Framboise, and to Fourch&eacute;, all quiet fishing villages remote from
travel highways, and on that account interesting to see.</p>
<p>When the Treaty of Utrecht gave France the right to hold and
fortify Cape Breton, the name of the Island became L&rsquo;Isle Royale, and
choice of a place was soon made for the erection of a stronghold or
fortress to maintain possession of this commanding approach to her
vast inland territory. Havre a l&rsquo;Anglois was the place selected,
and its name was changed to Louisbourg in honor of the French
monarch of that time, Louis XIV. The history of this interesting
place was for many years the history of the whole island.</p>
<p>Work on the fortifications of Louisbourg was commenced in
the early part of the eighteenth century. It continued for over
twenty years, and the whole defensive system was planned by Vauban,
the great French engineer. So strong was the place made that it
became known as the Dunkirk of America. Towards the middle of
the century the population of Louisbourg had increased to 4000,
and it was rapidly becoming a place of great importance. Islands
in the harbor were strongly fortified to command the water approach,
while on the land the solid fortification walls, over ten feet thick
<span class="pb" id="Page_286">286</span>
and more than thirty feet high, protected
by a great ditch with earthworks,
glacis, bastions and citadel, all united
to form an almost impregnable position.
The approaches could be swept by gun
fire from nearly 150 cannon.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_276">
<img src="images/p0294.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="372" />
</div>
<p>It was not long before the
British colonists of New England took
alarm at the construction of such formidable
works in a place where they could be used as a basis of
operations against them; a plan for attacking the fortress by volunteers
from Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island and New Hampshire
was agreed upon, and a strong expedition left Nantasket for Cape
Breton waters.</p>
<p>From the very first, success attended the efforts of the Colonials;
and after many spirited attacks, the place, though ably defended
by the French, fell before the continued assault. This was
in 1745. Three years later Cape Breton and its great fortress of
Louisbourg were given back to France by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>
<p>But there were to be other struggles between France and
England for supremacy in North American waters, and it was inevitable
that Louisbourg would again be attacked; and so in another
ten years a British fleet assembled in Gabarus Bay to the south of
Louisbourg, and another great struggle ensued. Boscawen, Amherst
and Wolfe took part in this assault; and the place was again ably
defended by the French, this time under the gallant de Drucour,
who was able to direct the fire of over two hundred cannon against
the invaders&mdash;so much had the defenses been strengthened. The
formerly successful plans of the Colonials were again followed, and,
as before, success came to the invaders, and Louisbourg fell with
immense stores and munitions of war. A strong naval station
being in existence by this time in Halifax, it was decided to totally
destroy the fortifications of Louisbourg, and accordingly the whole
of the defenses were demolished by an engineer corps from England,
sent out for this purpose. Shortly before the opening of the American
War of Revolution, Britain&rsquo;s conquest of all Upper Canada was
confirmed by treaty, and peaceful development of Cape Breton has
since ensued.</p>
<p>Louisbourg, thus interesting historically, is conveniently
reached from Sydney by rail. It has a pleasant harbor, free from
<span class="pb" id="Page_287">287</span>
winter ice, and is a fairly busy little shipping port. The site of the
old fortress is at Point Rochefort a few miles distant from the railway
station; but from first leaving the train, evidences of Louisbourg&rsquo;s
former greatness may be seen, and relics are in main of the houses
in the village. Cannon balls are still found in the surrounding fields,
and many of the houses contain stone from the demolished walls of
the fortress. The situations of the bastions may still be traced,
and some of the casemates used for sheltering the women and children
from gun fire during the attacks are now used as shelters by flocks
of sheep. That women can rise to any height when emergency
demands, is shown by the incident
remembered of Madame de Drucour,
wife of the French Governor
in the second siege, who with her
own hands fed the cannon with
powder and balls.</p>

<p>No systematic exploration of

<span class="pb" id="Page_288">288</span>
The graveyard, too, where French, English and Colonial dead lie in
hundreds, rests unmarked by stone of any kind. There is a general
monument, however, erected on the very spot where the keys of the
fortress were handed to General Pepperell when the fortress fell
before Colonial arms. It was erected by the Society of Colonial
Wars, and bears the simple inscription, &lsquo;To Our Heroic Dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cod fishing was formerly carried on extensively from Louisbourg.
Several of the old-time inhabitants owned thirty or forty
vessels each.</p>
<p>There are several small fishing settlements in the neighborhood
to which driving excursions may be made, and in summer time
a pleasant sailing trip may be taken to several villages on Gabarus
Bay to the south.</p>
<p>Leaving the South Shore to be visited from its most convenient
centre, St. Peters, the town of Baddeck may next be chosen
as a favorable place from which to view the central districts of the
Island, as well as those lying along the upper east and west coasts.
It will be remembered that steamers leave Sydney for east coast
points, and Mulgrave for places on the west coast; and these trips
are both enjoyable on fine summer days, affording as they do
pleasant views of many a quaint little harbor and village. But for a
thorough and intimate acquaintance with the beautiful island scenery,
driving trips and walks should be taken from Baddeck, Whycocomagh
and Mabou. Baddeck is easily reached from Sydney by
Intercolonial Railway to Grand Narrows or Iona, from which places
the steamer <i>Blue Hill</i> connects with incoming trains. Baddeck
may also be reached by steamer from Sydney.</p>
<p>The town of Baddeck is a pleasant little centre from which to
see much of the surrounding country; in addition, it is in itself a
homelike and quiet resort where enjoyable days of rest may be
spent, varied by drives and walks, and the comings and goings of
the several steamers that make this a place of call. It is a fine place
for boating and sailing, and it is one of the centres that most tourists
prefer, quiet and tranquil, but not deserted, and where some social
pleasures with other visitors may be enjoyed. It is undoubtedly
one of the best centres from which to see characteristic Cape Breton
scenery. The town is on a bay harbor of the upper Bras d&rsquo;Or Lake,
about midway between the northern outlet to the Atlantic and the
southern reach that ends in Whycocomagh Bay, being about twenty
miles or more from each place.</p>

<img src="images/p0297.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="500" />
</div>
<p>There are some beautifully-placed
bungalows along the shore, one of the
number belonging to George Kennan,
where that <i>litterateur</i> and energetic traveller
may be seen gardening in his moments of
leisure.</p>
<p>On a beautiful estate of a thousand
acres, not far from Baddeck, the eminent
scientist and inventor, Dr. Alexander
Graham Bell, has his summer home.
Wherever the telephone has reached,
Dr. Bell&rsquo;s name is known; and that is
tantamount to saying he is one of the best-known men of the
world. Dr. Bell is the exemplar of the scientific inventor, the
type that builds on sound knowledge, rational induction and
logical experiment, building up patiently and through years of
toil and diligent application, step by step, a scientific edifice that
would once have been deemed a daring conception of an
imaginative mind. More fortunate than other inventors, who,
like the alchemists of old, have toiled without rest or intermission&mdash;and
the fruits of whose labors have been denied them&mdash;Dr. Bell
has reaped the reward due to an honored member of that profession
which advances the progress of civilization by bounds of
a thousand years at a time; and here in Beinn Bhreagh, or
&ldquo;lovely mountain,&rdquo; he lives a life that is one of enjoyment&mdash;although
not one of ease in the sense that he &ldquo;does nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The estate is one that may be termed a perfect heaven for
the absorbed worker in scientific, literary or other mental effort
requiring surroundings favorable for concentration of thought.
Here with machine and wood-working shops, electrical laboratory,
erecting places and store houses for aeroplanes, wharves,
shelter houses and lake for testing
hydroplanes, the busy inventor
works away a good part of the
year when not at his Washington
home.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_280">
<img src="images/p0297a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="378" />
</div>
<p>Dr. Bell also gives time to
scientific stock-farming, and keeps
elaborate records of the excellent
results that are gained from time
to time. He has a competent
staff of workers, all housed in the
midst of ideal surroundings on his
estate.</p>

<p>The drives about Beinn
Bhreagh are exceedingly lovely,
and the ever-changing water view
is a continual source of delight.
&ldquo;Surprise View,&rdquo; well above the
level of the lake, has been well-named,
for in following the winding
woodland road a glorious
panoramic scene of great beauty
suddenly springs into view as if by magic.</p>
<p>A fine observation tower crowns the heights over all. From
it an unsurpassed view may be had of ocean, lake, woodland crest,
high mountain and pastoral valley.</p>
<p>The natural beauties of the neighborhood are truly remarkable.
Even the farms on the western or greater channel, facing
Boularderie, are beautifully situated on the heights, with picturesque
ravines and dells, and lovely little brooks of crystal that flow along
shady ways to the lake far below.</p>
<p>The whole wide world possesses few nobler views than that
seen from the living rooms and porches of the Beinn Bhreagh home.
It is an inspiring prospect, beautiful each morning as the sun illumines
the new continents and mountain ranges of cloudland; and
lovely by night when under the glorious tranquility of the stars, the
moon and her handmaidens, the fleecy clouds, weave arabesques of
unparalleled splendor.</p>

</div>
<p>A favorite drive is that from Baddeck to the upper waters of
the Baddeck River, and also by way of St. Ann&rsquo;s to the North River.
It was at St. Ann&rsquo;s that Nicholas Denys had one of his fortified posts
in early days. The river scenery is everywhere charming, with
pretty brooks, green woodland, banks of ferns, and clustering patches
of wild flowers. At St. Ann&rsquo;s and North River the water views are
very choice, and the drive is a constant succession of delights. There
is a grand side to the scenery of this district, for the mighty hills have
been riven asunder in many places, and romantic gorges are seen
from numerous places on the way. Indian Brook, with precipitous
banks, and rocky waterfall, is a delightful scene.</p>
<p>The little places on the coast road to Ingonish are far remote
from travel routes, and they are full of interest. The scenes are
extremely bold and striking, and by some are thought to resemble
the features of Norway. Cap Enfum&eacute;, commonly called &ldquo;Old
Smoky&rdquo; on account of its almost perpetual cap of mist, is a bold
object in the view, for it towers up almost perpendicularly for some
twelve hundred feet. This cape has been termed one of the eastern
bulwarks of North America, where the mighty deep lashed into fury
by the eastern tempests, thunders in vain against this eternal rampart.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_283">
<img src="images/p0300.jpg" alt="" width="395" height="500" />
</div>
<p>One of the finest panoramic views, and innumerable others
at close range, may be seen at and around Ingonish. Mountains,
islands, beautiful bays, nestling villages and
glorious air are here. Walks and excursions
on foot and by boat may be had in many directions,
and the beauties of the place need fear
comparison with no other district. The descent
on the other side is believed to be one of the
sights of the Maritime Provinces. The village
on the broad beach, the three harbors of Ingonish,
the picturesque lighthouse, beautiful
Ingonish Island, with its Sentinel Rock, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_293">293</span>
the far away Cape North range of mountains, make a picture of
superb beauty. Franey&rsquo;s Chimney itself is no inconspicuous object,
being nearly 1400 feet high. A French cruiser once went ashore not
far from Money Point, and active tides were wont to throw up gold
coins from the wreck on to the strand. For some years people used
to go gold fishing, with long poles having the ends daubed with pitch
to which the coins adhered. Ingonish was known in French days
as Inganische, and relics of those days may still be found. There is
excellent bathing at Ingonish and it is a splendid place for a summer
vacation of a restful kind. Neil&rsquo;s Harbor, Aspy Bay and Cape
North are usually reached by steamer, and inland from these places
will be found unexplored land where caribou and bear are still
found. This whole area, including Bay St. Lawrence, is beautiful,
and destined to become more and more frequented as hotels
are built and roads and other facilities are improved; and in due
time a railway will doubtless skirt the coast.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_284">
<img src="images/p0301.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="580" />
</div>
<p>Out in the Atlantic in the direction of Newfoundland, about
15 miles north-east of Cape North, is the rocky island of St. Paul&rsquo;s.
It is right in the highway of ocean travel to and from the Gulf of St.
Lawrence. Many wrecks have happened here, with the loss of thousands
of lives. A hundred years ago as seamen approached the
Island, they used to keep a look-out for the sight of the immense
flocks of sea-fowl known as the great auk. These birds, now extinct,
used to keep inshore; and never ventured out to sea. They
were thus a sure indication of the proximity of land. They were
so innocent that sailors could draw near and capture them by the
boat-load. They were about as large as a goose, with short wings,
coal black head and back, white beneath, and a milk-white spot
under the right eye. Of negligible value
in those days, a stuffed specimen of
the great auk to-day is worth fifteen
hundred dollars. The island has now
lost most of its dangers, for the sailor
of to-day sees the bright flashes from
the lighthouse when nearly twenty miles
out at sea, while in thick weather he is
warned by the fog-gun. A splendid
series of drives may be taken from
Baddeck, by way of Hunter&rsquo;s Mountain,
and through the Wagamatcook or
Middle River district, by Lake O&rsquo;Law,
to Margaree Forks and Margaree Harbor on the west coast. No
scenery can charm more than this&mdash;it is delightful. The Middle
River waters are exceedingly pretty, the valley is a beautiful one,
and the pastoral scenes are as fresh and enjoyable as can be.
There is a comfortable and homelike hostelry in this district.
The Margaree River, a splendid salmon stream, is full of romantic
interest, for it affords a constant succession of charming views,
and here, too, everything is fresh and smiling. None may pass
through such spots without enjoying to the full that feeling of
exhilaration that accompanies the sight of such a wealth of all
that is beautiful in nature.</p>

<p class="caption">Whycocomagh</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">295</div>
<p>The drive may be prolonged to Cheticamp, by putting up
overnight at places between Baddeck, Middle River, Margaree, etc.
It is an Acadian fishing village, the inhabitants of which have lived
their simple lives for more than two centuries undisturbed by all
that goes on in the outer world. The interior country is beautiful,
and is much diversified by streams of the clearest water. This, too,
although remote, is a favorite spot for the nature-lover who would
see the quiet life of the people in such far-away settlements. There
is much that is picturesque in the region of the hilly Cheticamp
valley, and it is a district that will also be opened up in due time on
account of the gold and other minerals that have been found there.</p>
<p>The return to Baddeck may be made by way of Inverness,
Strathlorne, Lake Ainslie, Mabou and Port Hood, in which event
it is not much out of the way to include Whycocomagh in the circuit.
Or the journey may temporarily end at Whycocomagh, and that
place be chosen as a centre from which to see the surrounding country,
without the necessity of returning to Baddeck. As there is a
steamer from Baddeck to Whycocomagh, and as it is a very enjoyable
trip, made pleasant by the fine scenery on the way, many may
prefer to see the east coast and central districts from Baddeck, and
then view the west coast, middle-west and south-west districts
from Whycocomagh.</p>
<p>The scenery in and around Whycocomagh is very beautiful,
and its picturesque bay has been called the &ldquo;Naples of America.&rdquo;
The country round about is most varied, and from the top of Salt
Mountain a splendid view is commanded; nor is it necessary to climb
that height unless so disposed, for the scenery by the shores of the
bay is exceedingly fine. Whycocomagh is an ideal centre for boating
and canoeing, and here, as at Baddeck, splendid opportunities exist
for enjoyable cruises by motor-boat. There is bathing also, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_296">296</span>
fishing; and many pleasant days may be spent at this peaceful little
resort.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_286">
<img src="images/p0304.jpg" alt="" width="606" height="500" />
<p class="caption">A Picnic Party</p>
</div>
<p>Port Hood, Mabou and Lake Ainslie are all within convenient
reach by carriage. Port Hood has coal mines, a safe harbor, and is
the centre of a good farming district. Mabou is one of Cape
Breton&rsquo;s most characteristic little places, and the scenery all through
this neighborhood is charming. The town itself is very quaint
and enjoyable, while the river and woodland walks and drives
are all excellent. There is a very comfortable little hotel here,
and a restful vacation may well be spent in this pleasant place as
a centre for a series of quiet excursions in quest of nature&rsquo;s beauties.
The Trout River and Lake Ainslie are also good objectives for drives
and rambles, for the scenery in this region is full of charm.</p>
<p>Returning to Whycocomagh, and taking the steamer to
Baddeck, and through the Bras d&rsquo;Or Lake to St. Peter&rsquo;s Canal at its
southern outlet, a stay may be made in quiet St. Peter&rsquo;s, the Port
Toulouse of olden days, to enjoy its calm and tranquil summer life.
This place was formerly known as Port Toulouse and was one of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_297">297</span>
fortified trading stations founded by N.
Denys. It may be well to note here that
several places on this coast, though still
retaining their French names, are now exclusively
peopled by the Scotch. While
the scenery of the south coast districts
does not compare with that of other
parts of the island, the neighborhood of
St. Peter&rsquo;s is a thoroughly pleasant one. From here excursions may
be made to the beautiful island-studded body of water known as
Loch Lomond, to L&rsquo;Ardoise and also to Arichat, Petit de Grat, and
D&rsquo;Escousse, on the island known as Isle Madame. Here the visitor
will find himself in another world&mdash;the Acadian world of long ago;
and the quaint life so different from that of a few hundred miles
south cannot fail to make a lasting impression on the minds of all
that sojourn for a while in these remote little outposts.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_287">
<img src="images/p0305.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" />
</div>
<p>The return to Point Tupper and Mulgrave may be made
either by rail or steamer.</p>
<p>There are splendid fishing rivers in Cape Breton, and fine
trout streams are everywhere. Hunting, and shooting of wild birds,
in season is excellent, too. Particulars relating to all Cape Breton
outdoor sports will be found in the Chapter &ldquo;Where to Go.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>The choice of a vacation place suited to individual
requirements is a matter of considerable
importance, and for those planning to visit a
country that is new to them, a brief description
of the merits of various places will be very
helpful. The amusements and recreations of
each district are here given concisely. A preliminary
study of this chapter will enable visitors
to make intelligent choice of a locality best
suited to their needs; and full particulars of
any place under consideration may be read in the detailed description
of the district finally chosen.</p>
<p>There are, of course, hundreds of delightful spots where
happy vacations may be spent if the visitor has no preference for
any particular recreation. As is well known, however, some prefer
the shore, while others like the interior life by woodland and stream.
Others again are happiest when in or near some fairly busy town
centre, where some luxuries and a social life may be enjoyed. There
are others who prefer the simple and inexpensive life of the quiet
little village resort, and others yet who like the life of a fashionable
watering place. Then those who delight in yachting, boating,
canoeing, and all the pleasures of outdoor life, as well as fishing, etc.,
have their preferences; and the object of this chapter is to afford a
ready choice from those places exactly suited to particular requirements.</p>
<p>After the visitor has become familiar with the attractions of
the neighborhood selected, by actual residence there, he will be
able to explore in every direction; and in this way many a charming
place will be discovered that has in it the something for which he
has always longed&mdash;the life, the atmosphere so difficult to describe
and which appeal direct to the heart in some unexplained way.</p>
<p>It is so well understood that visitors come to the Maritime
Provinces for summer pleasures&mdash;and not to make a display of dress
<span class="pb" id="Page_300">300</span>
as at Atlantic City and similar resorts&mdash;that all who wish to do so
may wear plain and sensible attire, and be as unconventional as they
please. Of course in a few centres, such as Quebec, Murray Bay,
etc., fashionable costumes are in evidence; but even in these places
plain and sensible costumes do not call for remark; and while it is
not necessary to avoid the best hotels where richer people congregate,
there are always other comfortable hotels and stopping-places where
people of moderate means may live more quietly and be just as happy.</p>
<p>Those who make a short stay in any one place will have little
time for social life; but, after the day&rsquo;s pleasure is over, pleasant
social intercourse may be enjoyed&mdash;in all but the smallest places&mdash;with
those who are sojourning in the same locality. In the larger
centres social life is quite an enjoyable feature of the summer vacation,
and here, too, visitors mingle on the porches, etc. at night, and
pass many pleasant hours in discussing the scenery and other features
of the district. If making a stay of weeks or months at any one
place, it is a good plan to have introductions to some of its leading
people, as in this way many delightful hours will be spent in pleasant
society. Canadian people are very hospitable, as a rule, and in many
places of small and medium size, visitors will frequently be asked to
participate in tennis, boating and driving, etc., as soon as they have
settled down in summer quarters. In all places of any pretensions
as summer resorts, golf, tennis, bathing, etc., are provided by the
management of the principal stopping-places, and in such resorts
the visitor enjoys such recreation without having to await an invitation
from residents&mdash;as must necessarily be the case in small
places where no public facilities of the kind are provided.</p>
<p>Where an asterisk * is inserted before the name of a place or
district, under any heading such as &ldquo;Historic Interest,&rdquo; &ldquo;Summer
Vacation Life,&rdquo; &ldquo;Yachting,&rdquo; &ldquo;Canoeing,&rdquo; etc., it denotes a place of
commanding excellence for the enjoyment of that particular interest.</p>

<p>Yachting waters of most enjoyable character are found at
Quebec and all St. Lawrence River resorts; and at *Campbellton,
*Dalhousie, *Bathurst and other Bay of Chaleur points, including
several places on the Gasp&eacute; peninsula;
*Newcastle and *Chatham, on Miramichi

</div>
<p>Motor-boating may always be enjoyed
where good yachting waters are found, and
hence all the places just enumerated as most
suitable for yachting are also well adapted for
motor-boating. The motor-boat being independent
of the wind has an increased range of
action, and on that account additional places
are now named from which cruises may be
made as a centre. As motor-boats are also
able to move in more restricted water than the wind-propelled yacht,
additional river places having pleasant cruising waters are here
added, such as the *Saguenay, *Miramichi, *Fredericton, Kennebecasis
River, the lower waters of the larger Prince Edward Island
rivers, Mira River, Canso Strait, the splendid harbors and rivers
east of Halifax, Minas Basin and on the waters of several of the
large interior lakes accessible from or contiguous to convenient towns
of fair size.</p>
<p>Quiet waters for pleasant boating amidst enjoyable surroundings
will be found at every one of the numerous St. Lawrence River
resorts from Quebec to Matane, on all of the fine rivers in the four
provinces, in the Bay of Chaleur from *Matapedia, *Campbellton
and *Dalhousie along the south shore of the Gasp&eacute; Peninsula as far
as *Gasp&eacute; Bay, along the southern and eastern shores of Chaleur,
along the whole interesting water front of the Northumberland
Straits, and along the Bay of Fundy shore. As a matter of fact,
good rowing waters are found within convenient reach of nearly
every station on the Intercolonial Route, and all the places named
in connection with yachting and motor-boating will be found to
have suitable boating waters nearby.</p>
<p>One of the most enjoyable and healthful recreations is that of
canoeing; and, as is well known, the canoeing waters of Quebec
and the Maritime Provinces are without a rival in any part of the
world. A whole lifetime of summers may be spent on these beautiful
waters without exhausting the novelty and interest of scene that
everywhere abounds. Every river of the four provinces has its
canoeing attractions; and for a vacation of perfect delight no better
<span class="pb" id="Page_303">303</span>
plan can be followed than that of shipping
a canoe over the Intercolonial Railway
to the chosen centre of operations, and
from there explore the district, to become
acquainted with all its beauty and charm.
All along the St. Lawrence River, and in
its numerous tributaries, splendid canoeing
waters are found. The great *St. John
River, with its sparkling tributaries flowing
through unfrequented woodland depths,
is a superb highway full of romantic interest.
The *Miramichi, *Nepisiguit,
*Matapedia, *Tobique, *Restigouche,
*Temiscouata and a host of other rivers in Nova Scotia (including
Cape Breton) and Prince Edward Island give such a
wealth of delightful canoeing waters that a choice is almost
embarrassing. Nor must the smaller streams be passed by without
notice, for in these also are found the wooded islands, murmuring
rapids and sylvan retreats dear to the hearts of those who &ldquo;paddle
their own canoe.&rdquo; There are hundreds of such places in the Maritime
Provinces, and consequently a study of this book as a whole is
recommended in order to make intelligent choice of that locality
best suited to the tastes of the individual canoeist.</p>

<p>Tennis courts will be found in nearly all places larger than
the small village of a few hundred inhabitants. In any place frequented
by summer visitors the Tennis Clubs make provision for
summer membership of visitors on payment of a small fee. In
many places where no regular club has been established the privileges
of the court are extended to visitors. In all of the summer resorts
of the lower St. Lawrence excellent tennis facilities are provided, and
this is true of the resorts of the provinces generally. In the small
and restful stopping-places not yet known as resorts, but to which
some summer visitors find their way, tennis courts are generally
found&mdash;so universal has this healthful outdoor recreation become.
It should not be forgotten that all through the Maritime Provinces
the summer climate is so temperate that full enjoyment of tennis
and outdoor sports brings with it none of the enervating fatigue
inseparable from such recreation in warmer climes.</p>
<p>Golf links are not as commonly found as tennis courts, but
nearly all summer hotels and resorts, other than the smallest, have
made provision for the enjoyment of this exhilarating game. Some
<span class="pb" id="Page_304">304</span>
of the courses in the Maritime Provinces are the
finest to be found anywhere; and there the game
may be enjoyed with all the accompaniment of
beautiful scenery, bracing air and romantic surroundings.
Eastern Canada is the land of summer
sports, where generous physical exercise may
be taken without lassitude or undue fatigue; and
in a game such as golf, where much ground
must be covered, a cool climate greatly enhances
the enjoyment of outdoor exercise.</p>

<p>The bathing waters of the provinces offer various temperatures
to suit different classes of bathers. Leaving out of consideration
river and lake bathing, the sea-bathing waters will be found to
offer a considerable range of temperature. The inner waters of the
*Bay of Chaleur, and the various places along the *Gasp&eacute; Peninsula,
along the Northumberland Strait shore, and those of *Prince
Edward Island generally, will be found best suited to the average
bather. Many go to the St. Lawrence River resorts between
Murray Bay and Little M&eacute;tis because there the water is warmest.
This is not river bathing as some might suppose, for even at Murray
Bay resorts one bathes in the briny water of old ocean. As the St.
Lawrence River reaches the Gulf it broadens to ocean proportions,
and at *Little M&eacute;tis and *Matane, and along the Gasp&eacute; shores,
bathing in pleasantly-warmed sea water may be enjoyed. Prince
Edward Island enjoys a reputation for pleasant bathing at a
moderate temperature, but as the outer waters near Cape Breton are
reached, an increasing coolness is noticeable, until the outer Atlantic
shore is gained, and here, of course, the tidal water is the coldest,
and best suited for those of robust physique. West and east of Halifax, however,
there are numerous inner waters of lagoon or almost land-locked character,
and many outer bay waters, too, where the sun warms the sand shoals at low tide, and
where, consequently, warmer bathing may be enjoyed than that found on the open
or outlying beaches.</p>

<p>The fishing waters of Eastern Canada are renowned all the world
over. Who has not heard of the *Restigouche, *Miramichi, *St.
John, *Nepisiguit, *Matapedia, *Tobique, *Upsalquitch, *Patapedia,
*Godbout, *Bonaventure, *Cascapedia, *Margaree, and all that
immense host of other rivers of various sizes that so liberally water the
Maritime Provinces, and afford fishing sport of the best kind for those
who love to catch the kingly salmon and princely trout.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_296">
<img src="images/p0314a.jpg" alt="" width="483" height="500" />
</div>
<p>The power of wealth is felt in
the angling world, just as in other
departments of life, and hence the
most of the best fishing rights have been bought up by wealthy
men and reserved for their own use and that of their friends and
summer guests. But there are many places where the best of fishing
may be had by previous arrangement, and other places, such
as the *Charlo River in New Brunswick, where royal fishing may
be enjoyed without permit other than the usual fishing license. The
best plan is to read through &ldquo;Summer Provinces by the Sea&rdquo; so
as to become acquainted with the country as a whole, and, after a
district has been chosen, a letter of inquiry to the nearest Intercolonial
Station Agent will elicit the latest and most accurate information
on the fishing of the neighborhood. The &ldquo;Fishing and
Hunting&rdquo; booklet issued by the Intercolonial Railway contains
much valuable information relating to the fishing streams of the four
provinces. This booklet will be forwarded from the offices of the
Intercolonial Railway, Moncton, N.B., on application.</p>
<p>The joy of pitching a tent, and of living next to nature on the
shore of the deep Atlantic, is a fascination that must lure increasing
thousands from the crowded and stifling cities; and for those
who desire more of the comforts of civilization, with a life as near
nature as possible, there are bungalows by lake, river and sea where
deep draughts of cool and invigorating air may be enjoyed on
porches, or in living rooms that may be thrown open at will to
admit every health-giving breeze that blows.</p>

<p>All of the places mentioned in the chapter &ldquo;Summer Resorts
of the Lower St. Lawrence,&rdquo; and many places in their neighborhood,
are suitable for bungalow and tent life, and well adapted for those
who prefer the more quiet and inner sea waters; and many charmingly-placed
summer homes will be found all through this attractive
district, at *Murray Bay, *St. Ir&eacute;n&eacute;e, Rivi&egrave;re du Loup, *Cacouna,
*Bic, and Little M&eacute;tis, etc. In New Brunswick, on the banks of the
St. John and other rivers, on the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Bay of
Fundy shores, and in the interior woodland by lake and waterfall
are many finely-placed summer cottages and vacation homes that
are half-shack, half-tent, and where a glorious outing may be enjoyed
at only a nominal cost. Nova Scotia and Prince Edward
Island both provide ample variety for this kind of life, while the
eastern extremity of Nova Scotia, the Island of Cape Breton, offers
a wealth of beautifully situated and romantic sites for summer tent
and bungalow that cannot be surpassed in any country of the world.</p>
<p>For driving and country rambles, woodland walks, botanizing,
gathering ferns and wild flowers, observation of the habits of birds
<span class="pb" id="Page_308">308</span>
and animals, and for the student of nature, the artist, the nature-lover
and all who appreciate the profound thought and concentration
promoted by the quiet and tranquility of woodland, forest and
secluded country lane, the Maritime Provinces offer all that is beautiful
in nature, combined with cool days and glorious nights. Who
that walks about by day, in such a climate, can help feeling the
buoyancy of spirit and feeling as of walking on air; and who that
rambles by river, lake or shore at night but realizes that here he is
indeed under the stars. The perfume of the flowers, the song of
the birds, the wind whispering through the trees, and the far-away
echo of the surf on the moonlit strand, all bring joy to the heart;
and as we take our way by a forest of noble birch trees, the mysterious
and thrilling sounds that come from its depths seem like an
invitation to enter and tarry awhile&mdash;to &ldquo;adore, and be still&rdquo;&mdash;to
spend an hour of quiet contemplation in yonder glade, where the
moon&rsquo;s soft light clothes every graceful, bending flower in a robe of
gleaming splendor. The districts around *Quebec are particularly
interesting to the nature-lover, while the *Bay of Chaleur, Prince
Edward Island, the *Wentworth, *Matapedia, *Miramichi and
*Nashwaak Valleys, the Upper and Lower *St. John River districts,
and all the bye-places of Nova Scotia, and particularly of the
*Cape Breton district, are full of interest for drives, rambles, etc.,
in the enjoyment of nature.</p>
<p>Many who enjoy country life will find their way to Quebec,
St. John, Charlottetown, Halifax, and Sydney, etc., and from these
places will afterwards pass on to some quiet spot where the simple
life may be enjoyed on a farm at very small expense, and from
which stopping-place, as a centre, drives and
rambles may be taken in every direction.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_299">

<p>The route of the Intercolonial Railway is through a country that is rich in
game; indeed the Maritime Provinces are the chief hunting grounds of North America.
Moose and deer are still abundant, and in parts of Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia there are districts not difficult of access where bears may be shot. The upper
part of Cape Breton Island is excellent for large game. From any of the principal
centres in Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia hunting parties may be
<span class="pb" id="Page_309">309</span>
equipped, and guides obtained, in the proper season. Like the fishing
places of the Maritime Provinces, the hunting localities are
so numerous that it would be impossible to do justice to them
in this book of general description. A special booklet, &ldquo;Fishing and
Hunting,&rdquo; will be forwarded from the offices of the Intercolonial
Railway, Moncton, N.B., on application.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_300">
<img src="images/p0317.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="291" />
</div>
<p>Wild fowl, small game and shore birds are found in almost
every part of the Maritime Provinces. The *Bay of Chaleur,
*Prince Edward Island, and the shore along the *Straits of Northumberland
all have numerous places where good shooting may be
had in season. The interior rivers and many of the coast streams
also afford fine shooting; and it is almost impossible to find a locality
in which small game of some kind is not abundant. Particulars
relating to small game and wild fowl districts will be found in
the hunting pamphlet to which reference has just been made.</p>
<p>Automobile traffic is becoming world-wide, and with the
attention that is now given to road improvement in nearly all
parts of Canada, the highways of Quebec and the Maritime Provinces
have not been overlooked. In Prince Edward Island the use
of automobiles is prohibited, but in Quebec, New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia there is a splendid choice of interesting tours. Particulars
of these in detail may be obtained from the road maps published
in New York; and the Automobile Clubs of Quebec, St. John
and Halifax, etc., are always glad to give specific information relating
to their province.</p>
<p>To enjoy intimate views of woodland, stream, lake and waterfall,
it is often necessary to leave the main roads or highways. Inner
glades, breezy heights, forest depths, the rocky bed of some
foaming cascade, or the winding course of a plashing brook, bordered
by wildflowers, must all be sought on foot.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_301">
<img src="images/p0317a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="250" />
</div>
<p>In all districts that are rich in such beauties it is best to tarry
<span class="pb" id="Page_310">310</span>
at the nearest hostelry and enjoy the country by rambling about on
foot. If such excursions are supplemented by trips in canoe, row-boat,
sail-boat, and motor-boat of ordinary speed, an intelligent
view of the country, its people, and its great resources of natural
beauty will then be possible&mdash;a view that would not be within the
reach of those who limit the field of observation to what may be
seen from the seat of a speeding automobile.</p>
